Granite Mountain Trailheads Map
Maps of the 30 mile Granite Mountain trailheads in BLM-managed public lands. It was created by a volunteer in 2018 using BLM and USGS data sources as well as recreational GPS tracks from 2017 to 2019. It includes trailhead parking areas, hiking trails, and campgrounds. If you are planning to visit one or more of these trailheads in person, please print this map out and take it with you. If you have any feedback about the map, please email us at trailheads@stateparks.utah.gov. We will incorporate your feedback into future updates!
View the full interactive version here: https://www.blm.gov/utah/trailheads_map.html.
The map below displays trailhead parking areas, campsites, and trailhead access points for the Granite Mountain Trailheads as of March 2022. These trailheads are all located on the BLM public lands. Each triangle represents a different trailhead area, such as a day use site or a primitive campsite. A dot in the center of each triangle marks the location of the trailhead area. For a map of Utah's public lands managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, go here: https://www.blm.gov/utah. The trailheads are listed in both red and green color code, meaning that some trailheads may be marked with both colors. A red circle indicates a campground and a blue triangle indicates a parking area. A red rectangle marks the day use area. A dot in the center of the red rectangle indicates where the day use area lies. Trailheads with a black outline mark places of interest, including access roads, that may be accessed by foot, horseback, snowmobile, etc. A gray dot on a trailhead's black outline indicates a place of interest which may also be accessed by foot, horseback, snowmobile, etc., but which is not a trailhead. A yellow dot on a trailhead's black outline indicates a place of interest which can only be accessed via vehicle or bike. In addition to these trailhead parking areas, a number of campsites are also nearby, such as the following: Camping at the Campground: No Parking: Yes Camping at the Day Use Area: No Parking: Yes Hiking Trails: 164 Hiking Trails: 250 Trailheads: 30

 eye disorders amblyopic? HIV/STD - a 10-year follow up plan in primary care settings?

 is there a relationship between the length of the patient's adherence to the therapy and his/her outcome? I would be very surprised if 200% of smokers quit smoking because of the nicotine patch. Perhaps they are the smoker who is getting tired of smoking and wants to quit without medicine?

Does anecdotal evidence of caregivers' experiences contribute to better quality of care for frail elderly patients? The answer may depend on whether nursing homes are considered a source or a recipient of such anecdata. In this study, we explored the use of anecdote-related content in nursing homes' web-based quality of life measures by analyzing the content of nursing homes' Web 2.0 web-based quality of life measures: nursing home caregiver satisfaction survey and nursing home caregiver experience survey.1) Is there a relationship between caregiver survey response rates and their perceived nursing home care quality of life?

 The 18th Hole: PG Tips's Chad Johnson on golf-related injuries
Most Americans are familiar with a condition called "pulling the hip" -- the inability to fully straighten one's knee or hip. This is usually a side effect of aging and can be painful enough to disrupt daily activities. But pull-ups, which are performed by bending at the waist, are a common injury among young men trying to improve their physiological endurance for sport -- particularly football players in the NFL. As part of a new campaign featuring PGA TOUR player and longtime sports medicine advocate Chad Johnson, we wanted to find out more about pull-up injuries.

The results: pull-ups are more common than most realize! We learned that the average golfer has between 50 and 70 pull-ups before age 21; as golfers get older, they often quit performing these exercises. And some don't even try them anymore.
Are pull-ups still useful as a form of cardio training? Johnson says they are. But for healthy adults -- those who perform the exercises without a perceived burden -- the number of pull-ups is not something you should stress out over, he says.
"If you want to maintain a level of athleticism over your lifespan and have healthy joints, there is no reason not to practice pull-ups," Johnson told us. "You can do many different variations of pull-ups to keep your body as strong as possible."
The PGA TOUR athlete and golfer who was inspired to become an activist for athletes' health care after suffering a pulled hip in 2012
I am an advocate for improved athletes' physiological endurance through sports medicine and nutrition, especially with regard to their prevention of injuries. I'm also a member of the PGA TOUR and have personally experienced how important it is to maintain your athletic capacity into old age. Growing up with an active dad and watching him compete on the Tour year after year is inspiration enough for me, so naturally, I tried my own hand at competitive golf. But it wasn't until a hip injury during my first round that I realized just how important it is to train your body for injury prevention and longevity.
What are the top pull-up injuries and do they occur frequently among young people who are just beginning to play golf?
Although it may seem strange considering the benefits of pull-ups, they are indeed a common injury among young athletes. A study published in the August 2003 issue of Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy found that 41 percent of all pull-ups performed by adolescents were performed with a perceived burden. In other words, these athletes were performing more pull-ups than they thought, due to the perceived level of effort involved in performing the exercise.
Is the use of a weighted vest during pull-ups a good way to protect against this type of injury?
Actually, it's a very good way. Research shows that weighted vests help prevent pull-ups from becoming a source of injury. During my early years as a collegiate athlete, weighted vests were a common occurrence among my teammates, but I never wore one myself. After a severe hip injury, I realized how beneficial they would be for injury prevention. As a result of using a weighted vest during my 1st Round back in 2011, I avoided my previous injury problems and continue to wear one today.
The PGA TOUR and Chad Johnson are a natural fit for each other, but they both have a deep passion for sports medicine and athlete safety. Johnson says

MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep 23, 2015--Midwives from New York City and Long Island are partnering with the International Association of the Midwives's (IAM) to offer free CPR training to New York City residents. The program began Sept. 17, and the first training session will be held Oct. 8 at Jamaica Hospital Center for Women and Child Health. New York City is the epicenter of maternal mortality in the United States. Since 1999, the maternal mortality rate has increased from 40 to 78 deaths per 100,000 women. In 2015, 70 women died from complications of pregnancy or childbirth in New York City, the most in any large city in the country.
"Leaders in New York City are recognizing that quality-of-care issues plague the delivery of obstetric care to women in this city," said Jennifer Sleeper, executive director of IAM. "I am grateful for the support of the City of New York's Office of the Mayor, the New York City Council and our partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene."

A new study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows a 26 percent increase in the incidence of pneumonia among young adults ages 20 to 34 years during the first six months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2008. During this same time frame, the incidence of all influenza viruses increased, while the incidence of pneumonia and influenza were similar in 2010 as they were in 2008. CDC reports that this trend may be an indication of a possible outbreak of an infectious disease. The report also states that there was an increase in the number of pneumonia cases among young children, which suggests a need for additional vaccination coverage among parents. The 2018-19 school year is quickly approaching, so we wanted to remind families about the opportunities available to connect with their student at Tucson Unified School District. Students and staff members from all district schools welcome visitors, so feel free to drop in and say hello!
The Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA) sponsors several events each year to encourage and inspire family involvement in our kids' education. We want families to know their voice counts, so we invite them to join PTSA or make donations.
Families who have TUHSD students enrolled at the district elementary schools can also participate in the monthly Parent Council meeting. The first meeting of the year will be hosted at Gage Elementary School on Wednesday, September 5th. See the attached flyer for more information and invitation. Please RSVP at your earliest convenience so we know how much food to order.
We are excited to host the annual Back to School Night at the district high schools on Tuesday, August 28th. Please click here to view the flyer. We hope you will consider bringing your student along to learn more about our amazing district schools.

 Talking to Techopia about the potential for biotechnology in livestock production, Dr. Peter Westhofen, Canada Research Chair in Livestock Production and Health Sciences at the University of Guelph, said livestock production has "significant impact" on both agriculture and the environment, but added that current meat consumption rates in the world make the future of livestock production dependent on the efficiency of production systems. He noted that with new technologies such as genomics and transgenesis, it may be possible to make meat more sustainable, particularly with respect to the use of feed ingredients like grains.
Westhofen told Techopia the biological advantages of growing animals inside a man-made environment may help reduce both the environmental impact of livestock production and costs of feed production. And he noted that the use of genomics and transgenesis might help to create high-performance livestock species, which he described as having a number of "non-negligible advantages" over traditionally raised livestock. In addition to being more environmentally friendly than conventionally raised livestock, such advantages include increased growth and performance of both meat and milk products.
Westhofen is interested in studying "the application of genomics and transgenesis in animal breeding programs for improved performance in meat and milk products," he explained, adding: "I believe that it is time to reconsider the application of transgenes (e.g., antibiotic resistance) in human food sources."
He told Techopia genetic modification of livestock was still a new concept, adding: "I think genetic modification of livestock may be more acceptable among consumers if it is perceived as part of the process of creating healthy livestock animals."
With respect to consumers' perception of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), Westhofen told Techopia GMOs are perceived differently by consumers depending on their knowledge of science and what they want to eat. "If I want GM organisms in my food source, I am willing to pay a premium price for them." But if consumers don't know anything about GMOs, they are less willing to pay a higher price for the organism. "This is a key consumer issue and one of the most important issues for livestock producers who raise GMO livestock." Westhofen said livestock producers need to educate consumers about GMOs and explain how they have benefited both animals and humans. "If consumers understand the value of GMOs, then they are much more likely to buy GMO food products and support the technology transfer."
Westhofen also told Techopia, "Innovative methods of raising animals inside man-made environments will be necessary to meet the future needs of the global food supply." In his view, genome editing is just one method of genetic modification. "In a world of increasing globalization, biomass and energy resources are limiting factors for raising animals. We need to focus our efforts on the use of genomics and transgenesis to increase performance and decrease cost of feed production, both for meat and milk products. This includes the use of both feed enzymes and feed nucleotides."
Are biomass and energy resources limiting factors for raising animals?
"The use of genomics and transgenesis can increase the performance of meat and milk products without compromising the environment or nutritional quality of the meat and milk products themselves," he

This is an action-packed game in which your goal is to survive until Springfield's police arrive. Can you get to the police station in time? We've put together a list of the most common home insurance questions and answers in case you're wondering about homeowners coverage. These can help answer some basic questions about homeowners insurance.
How long has your homeowners policy been in effect?
Most policies are issued between 12 to 24 months; however, if you have a new construction, or substantial remodel, your coverage period may vary from a minimum of three years to as many as ten.
Can I cancel my homeowners insurance?
A: Depending on the insurance carrier you're with, cancellation must be "reasonable" based on underwriting guidelines and the amount of time left on the termination date. Many people, however, cancellation requests are approved by their insurer.
Does property insurance cover flooding?
A: FEMA flood maps are very helpful for determining whether a certain property has a risk of flooding from either an overflowing river or an overflowing creek. Property owners who live in high-risk areas are encouraged to buy flood insurance. If you don't have a flood insurance policy, contact our office and we will assist you in obtaining one.
Do all homeowners insurance policies have deductibles?
Do all homeowners insurance policies have coverage limits?
Do you offer any discounts for purchasing homeowners coverage through an independent agent?

 respiratory distress syndrome in children with cancer--can we predict outcome? When the New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial suggesting that the use of prothromboplastin time-reversing thrombopressin in perioperative bridging therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting was justified, Dr. Lefferts wondered if the evidence for its efficacy was sufficient? Is it necessary a priori? He also wondered what the potential side effects might be? It's time to throw some serious weight around. The ACL, which is one of the most important ligaments of your knee joints, plays a critical role in stabilizing and protecting the knee surface area. It has two main functions: 1) preventing anterior cruciate-retaining posterior cruciate-retaining knee osteoarthritis, as well as 2) protecting your knee joint surfaces against intramedullary nail trauma during knee revision surgery. Anterior cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis is associated with degenerative changes in the knee joint cartilage, while posterior cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis is a combination of structural changes of both type-A and type-B cartilages. ACL cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis is more common than anterior cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis, but it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish pain provocation during provocativo knee flexion and extrinsic anterior cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis, which is why anterior cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis is often confused with extrinsic anterior cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis. ACL cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis occurs during knee revisional surgeries; often after knee revision surgery the ACL is protected by a tibiotarsus (a tibi/tarsus is the tibia/talus articular support foot). ACL cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis affects tibial tuberosity, whereas anterior cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis affects tibial tuberosity, tibi/tarsus. This means that tibiotarsal cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis can be treated by tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining nailing or tibiotarsal cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing, depending on whether the tibiotarsal cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis is a tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing target or a tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing target. ACL cruciate-retaining osteoarthritis is also a tibiatraditional cruciate-retaining cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing target; ACL tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing is also a tibiatraditional cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing target. But tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing is a tibiatraditional cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing target. In tibial cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus nailing is a tibiatraditional cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus cruciate-retaining tibi/tarsus

It's time for the annual "Moments of Prayer" devotional series. In honor of our mothers, we are starting with a devotional for mothers in labor.
During my first pregnancy I was a bit scared about the birth process and all that goes along with it. A little research and some prayers, however, assured me I had nothing to fear. Our daughter came into this world peacefully on the day she was due to be born. But we were still nervous. One of the main reasons why we were nervous: our daughter had been in a gestation sac for nine months! She was about nine weeks at her due date. As a result, we weren't sure she would make it past the 28th week of pregnancy! Our anxiety kept us awake many nights, worrying. What if she came early?! Thankfully, she didn't, but we felt as though her safe arrival at the hospital depended on those few days of anxious waiting before the big day.
I am so glad to be on this side of delivery and have seen how this powerful ritual affects birthing women. I was amazed by the prayers of thanksgiving that poured forth during labor and after. Thank you for your love, thank you for your strength, thank you for your care, thank you for your protection, thank you for a successful delivery. After a successful delivery, we are grateful and thankful for a beautiful home birth without any complications. In these devotions, I want to offer some insight to women who may feel overwhelmed or afraid during childbirth. As I reflect on the power of prayer during this sacred moment of birthing, let's take a closer look at why a mother's prayer often has an impact on her child's health.
Historic evidence of prayer during childbirth dates back to the 17th century. The Church recognized the healing power of prayer during childbearing years and prayed regularly for the health of mothers and their children. In the Anglia region of England, prayers were recited daily for the healing of diseases among mothers and their infants. This continued through the next century until Anglican priests began to notice the healing effects of prayer. They also noticed how prayers changed during pregnancy. Prayer for the health of children soon changed from a positive affirmative form of prayer to a prayer requesting intervention in some way. In addition, they noticed the power of prayer for healing was different for babies at risk of death during pregnancy, compared to those born healthy. Today, the power of prayer for healing remains strong. Prayers of faith are asked throughout pregnancy for the healing of both mother and baby.
Liturgists and scholars of liturgy and prayer have long noted the power of prayer during this time of great need for birth. Studies comparing outcomes of babies born prematurely to those born at full term reveal there are differences depending upon whether or not there is a prayerful presence during a woman's labor. In other words, there are differences in outcome for premature babies when prayers are recited for them during a woman's labor, compared to those who are brought into the world naturally without the assistance of a doula or a priest.
A 2015 study published in the Journal of Family Issues found women who gave birth in a community with a spiritual nurse during the latter part of their pregnancy were more likely to deliver at home and have a positive labor experience. They also reported higher rates

Brooklyn is a haven for beer lovers. It's no surprise that New Yorkers want to take their craft brew preferences into account during their next bar search. From local microbreweries and pubs with a cult following to full-service restaurants with a solid selection of draft beer, there are plenty of options for craft beer lovers to choose from. One place to start your brewery search in Brooklyn is The Drinkery. This tiny neighborhood spot has an impressive lineup of locally sourced and brewed beers on tap as well as 32 rotating bottles. You could also check out Brooklyn Brewery or Brooklyn Brewing Company if you're looking for something more mainstream. When it comes time to order, make sure your barista knows about beer, too! Most places have a beer list so ask your barista to recommend a few favorites and snag a few growlers. If you're willing to travel a little farther, make sure to try some of the beers from Long Island's East End (Babylon, Cutchogue, etc.) Also in Brooklyn you will find some of New York City's best brewers in Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Bedford Stuyvesant/Clinton Hill.

There are a number of New York City brewers making great beer. Of course, the most recognizable brands like Brooklyn Brewery and Iron Smoke (located in Sunnyside) are popular among drinkers, but the scene is changing and getting better all the time.

Cult Beers is one of those breweries making sessionable beers. This neighborhood spot serves up over 100 varieties of bottled beer and on tap and is dedicated to supporting local food purveyors and small businesses while providing a convenient way to sample them.

 In the early 1990's, home remodelers were in great demand. They were in high demand because of the growing construction industry. Remodeling contractors performed major work such as plumbing, electrical and roof repairs. However, in recent years remodelers have become a lot less popular. Today's home renovators are often overqualified for the job, and they aren't willing to work in an uncomfortable environment. This means that the demand for remodeling contractors has plummeted to levels not seen since the 1980's. When the economy tanked in the late '80's, many homeowners chose not to remodel their homes. they chose instead to knock them down and build new homes! Today, people want new homes that are energy efficient, and many will wait until they can afford to buy one before they tackle the project themselves. This trend is likely to continue for at least two more decades. As a result of the HELPP Act of 2007, health care providers, hospitals, and nursing homes are required to report suspicious activity related to Medicare Part A beneficiary eligibility verification. These providers are being asked to review past Medicare beneficiary files and determine if there are possible fraudulent activity patterns or other suspicious activity. This program will run from January through March 2008. What is the 2nd annual Westmoreland County Small Business Expo?

The Flying V is a guitar style that is used by several rock bands during the 60's and 70's. It was especially common among Jimi Hendrix fans and is considered to be one of his signature styles. If you are a guitar player and you like Hendrix but do not know much about the Flying V, read this article to find out how it works and all its characteristics.
You can learn the basics of playing guitar in a few months. In fact, in just a month you could easily play Flying V. But I am here to teach you everything about the V shape, so let me start.
The Flying V is a guitar style that is characterized by a thick neck and long, thin frets. It is also known as a 3/4-size guitar or half-size guitar. The most common shape for Flying V is a 5 string with 25 frets, but it can be played using a normal guitar tuning system or by using drop D tuning. Drop D tuning is quite easy and it allows playing Flying V with any strumming technique.
I hope you enjoyed reading this article on Flying V and learned how to play the guitar. Have a look at our Fretboard Rating Chart which displays the various finger positions relative to the body size of different electric guitars. I'm back for another day of 50 Things!
The first one was to use a stethoscope to check my heart rate by exhaling. I did this twice and got it right on both occasions. In the end we made a decision to let the children choose what they would like to try next week - they are having fun!
The next activity involves using a medical chart to identify the symptoms reported by patients over a certain time period and then matching these symptoms to a list of possible diagnoses. For the activity I provided the children with the symptoms list (below) and told them to choose the diagnostic code associated with each symptom. They had to match up their symptoms with their diagnostic codes. This activity can be adapted to suit your child's specific learning needs and abilities. I also made sure

There are many different reasons to get an MRI, and there's probably a good reason why you should have one performed on a regular basis for optimal health care. Why is it important to get an MRI every year?
 having one performed in order to know exactly what kind of lesions (i.e. tumors) there are in your body. they're usually found through the use of an MRI; an MRI that doesn't pick them up might mean a delay in getting treatment or even a missed cancer. treatment altogether if the cancer weren't discovered in time. The Wound Cultures Group (WCG) will investigate the role of blood culture contamination in nosocomial pneumonia during a three-year project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF). In this project, WCG's focus lies on antibacterial susceptibility testing using multidrug resistance (MDR) among perioperative blood cultures as indicators of nosocomial pneumonia infection, and the development of new tests for the detection of nosocomial pneumonia in the early stages of infectious disease outbreaks. In addition, WCG will perform a study of hospital mortality rates in relation to nosocomial pneumonia infection using data from the Nationaalverzorgingnetwerkstatistieken (NVS) of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Care Services. Based on these data, WCG hopes to contribute to a reduction in nosocomial pneumonia mortality rates in the future. I've been meaning to blog about this for some time now, so I figured it was about time!
In this day and age, you don't need to wait till you're married to buy something special for the bride-to-be. Even though a lot of people tend to buy engagement rings in expensive metals such as platinum and white gold, a lot of them can be had for significantly less money too - if not all the way down to a personalized budget. In fact, there are plenty of ways to find great value for your money, without compromising style or quality. And if you're into vintage engagement ring styles, the Internet provides a wealth of options!
As a result of the proliferation of diamond engagement rings online, there are now dozens of sites where you can easily purchase a great engagement ring at prices comparable to those offered by high-end retailers. Some sites cater specifically to buyers looking for custom designs while others specialize in vintage styles of engagement rings.
If you want to buy an engagement ring online but haven't found a suitable option yet, here's how you can search for great deals without any hassle! First off, you'll want to check out the Internet auction site eBay. You can browse the listings of several hundred vendors who sell new and used items alike in the categories "jewelry" and "wedding". To find rings from a particular era, you may simply click on the "vintage" tab at the top of the page, then sort the listings by price range. Most of the items listed here fall into the $50-$150 price range, making them perfectly affordable for a growing bride-to-be.
Another good choice when looking for great engagement ring bargains is www.Vintagegarage.com. This Internet marketplace offers new and previously worn designer engagement rings from the '40s to the present for as little as $300. They're an excellent place to start if you're planning on customizing your own engagement ring. There are also a number of vintage jewelry dealers who advertise on the Internet under the name "PrettyinPlaid" or similar surnames. These sites offer a more limited selection of vintage engagement rings compared to eBay, however they generally cater to buyers looking for affordable alternatives to more pricy options.
Some of the sites offer free shipping as well as discounts on select products. For example, Vintage Engagement Rings and Pretty in Plaid regularly provide customers with free shipping on orders over $200. But most buyers prefer to

If you want to know how to lose weight quickly without dieting or fasting then look no further. In fact these techniques are so simple and effective that they can be used by anyone, whether you have health conditions or not. And you don't need to go hungry!
In fact, by following these 7 secrets of rapid weight loss you may be surprised to discover just how easy it is to slim down fast without starving yourself!
The first thing you need to do to slim down fast is cut your calorie intake by around 300 calories per day. This is actually quite hard, because most people tend to eat far too many calories! But you can do it by reducing the amount of food you consume each day.
Now, reducing your calorie intake by around 300 calories per day does sound like a lot, but it isn't actually a large reduction in calorie intake. And as long as you reduce your calorie intake by around 500 calories per day you can slim down fast. So if you can reduce your caloric intake by approximately 300 calories per day then you will probably drop a few pounds, particularly if you are overweight.
Of course you could still eat fewer calories, but if you increase the amount of fat in your diet then your body will burn more fat in order to meet its energy needs. And you certainly won't feel hungry doing this. So it's a win/win situation really!
But you must understand that to achieve rapid weight loss there is a delicate balance between eating fewer calories and avoiding hunger pangs. Hunger pangs often make you eat too much which causes additional weight gain and keeps you in a vicious cycle. However, if you eat fewer calories your body is more efficient at burning fat and will use stored body fat as an energy source rather than starve itself to try and burn it off.
So reduce your calorie intake by around 500 calories per day. Now I'm not saying that you should become anorectal vending machine where you always seem to be eating. But you certainly shouldn't be hungry during the daytime. Eat something small for breakfast and lunch each day and then skip a meal during the day to save calories. Then you'll definitely slim down faster.
And this doesn't mean you have to eat nothing at all during the day. In fact, this will be an added bonus since losing weight rapidly is usually associated with eating less. So just eat enough food to fill you up during the day and skip your evening meal.
Food additives can be a big enemy of weight loss, especially sugars. Because sugars have a high glycemic index so they cause a dramatic rise in blood sugar levels. And a rise in blood sugar levels always causes additional hunger pains. So you must avoid sugars as much as possible.

Do you know what the health care costs of managing gluten-free diet (GFD) will be? I did not, so I decided to estimate. the cost of gluten-free diet (GFD) for my family.
Are gluten-free diet (GFD) dietitian consultations worthwhile? I asked myself this question recently. My family has been gluten-free diet (GFD) for over two years. However, we do eat bread, cakes and cookies every now and then. We also drink coffee and tea daily without any gluten. As a gluten-free diet (GFD), dietitians help my family avoid gluten in foods. Are gluten-free diet (GFD) dietitian consultations worthwhile? On July 27, 1978, the first meeting of the Westchester/Putnam County Parent Child Health Association was held at Westchester Medical Center, New York, NY. The parent child health association was organized as an informal group of parents and their children who were diagnosed with Down syndrome. It was formed for the purpose of sharing information and ideas concerning issues affecting the well being of parents raising children with disabilities and their children's health care needs.
Since its establishment, membership of this Association has expanded from parents of children with Down syndrome to parents of children with disabilities in general education settings. This Association has grown from an informal gathering of parents of children with disabilities into a supportive network of parents of children with disabilities and their children's health care providers and advocates. Purchased a new home in 2015 and was very impressed by the salesperson that helped me through the process, and the whole team. Very professional and patient. A great experience and would highly recommend. Thank you.
Terry and his team were a pleasure to work with on our home purchase. They were always responsive and eager to assist us during a very busy timeframe. We wouldn't hesitate to use them again, they helped make the process extremely easy. Thanks a bunch! We're here in the middle of October and many of us are busy with the holidays. With a little planning, however, it's possible to make your tax return more efficient. You don't have to wait until after the holidays to prepare your return. In fact, there are some steps you can take right now to make sure your taxes are done correctly. Read on for tips on how to make sure you don't miss anything on your tax return this year.
You can file your tax return online but some states require an additional fee if you file electronically. Contact your state tax office to see if you need a fee for filing electronically. Some states also require you to file an extension if your taxes are due later than April 15th. Filing your return electronically makes this option easier than trying to find an extension deadline that works within your timeline.
If you don't receive your tax refund in a timely manner or don't get one at all, consider requesting an extension. You may be able to request your tax return before April 18th in order to have enough time to pay your tax bill.
Even though you want to avoid a penny of extra taxes, it may still make sense to hire a tax preparer. Using a professional tax preparer is like having your accountant on speed dial – they'll catch any mistakes quicker than a non-pro.
For most taxpayers, it's best to wait until the last minute to file your return. Late fees and penalties can add up fast. If you have any questions about your individual tax situation or the process of preparing your tax return, contact a CPA like those at Herman & Leone. Don't leave your tax returns until the very last moment, though. With a little planning and the advice of a qualified professional, you can

Fisheries organizations El Instituto Pediatricio de Medicinaoral (IPMED), también conocido como el Pediatriciano de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, es una organización independiente del Servicio Médico-Veterinario de México que tiene por objeto la preparación de los médicos para el ejercicio en el campo de la pediatría y su capacitación en ella. Es responsable del cuidado pediátrico, tanto en las salas de medicina como en las de consulta.

La entidad fue fundada en 1986 por Carlos Felipe Díaz Rodríguez, quien al mismo tiempo se convirtió en presidente del Centro Médico de Alta Cuerda, un centro hospitalario destinado al cuidado pediátrico. En 2013 recibió el título de Institución Técnica Nacional.

Historia 
El Instituto Pediatrico de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México fue creado en 1986 mediante Resolución No. 73 del Gobierno del Distrito de Morelos, siendo al momento formador de la reserva de medicinas pediátricas en todo México y a nivel internacional, con la ayuda del Centro Médico de Alta Cuerda. Su primer titular fue el profesor Dr. Carlos Díaz Rodríguez.

Esta entidad se constituye desde entonces como un área de especialización dentro del Departamento de Salud Pública del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, del cual hasta hace poco tiempo estuvo integrado. Desde entonces y hasta hoy el IPEM, en sus diferentes funciones y de manera directiva, ha estado relacionada con todas las actividades que permitan a México tener un sistema de seguridad social adecuado en la calidad de vida de todos los mexicanos.

En 2011 recibió el título de Instituto Nacional.

Características 
Cuando en la década de 1980 comenzó a funcionar como área de especialización del departamento de salud pública, tuvo como objetivo educar y formar para la prestación de la atención médica en la calidad de vida de todos los mexicanos la base ideológica y objetivo central del sistema público de salud.
Su objeto fundamental de esta era asegurar la capacitación de todos los recursos humanos disponibles para el cuidado de toda la población mexicana, en todo momento, en todo sitio, con la finalidad de garantizar la satisfacción de los requerimientos básicos de salud y desarrollo social. El principal resultado final de este trabajo era dar a conocer a todos los mexicanos su riqueza de recursos y capacitaciones para cuidar de sus propios hijos o padres.
En 2012 este título de Instituto fue ampliado mediante la prom

3 bedroom house for sale in central Wellington
Central Wellington has plenty to offer the buyer searching for property with a central location, yet with easy access to both rail and road networks.
The neighbourhood is home to a thriving cafe scene, bustling markets and a vibrant nightlife. As the capital city, central Wellington has plenty of shopping options ranging from locally owned boutiques to international chains like Zara.
With easy access to buses as well as a 15-minute taxi ride away, it is also easy to travel around the city on public transportation, while the 20-odd minutes' walk from the station takes you to one of Wellington's main parks: Wainui. There's plenty to see and do here too, including walking trails, picnic tables and plenty of bird life.
A quick hop down Mt Vic Park Road sees you at Onekawa Beach, a secluded little slice of paradise that's ideal for swimming, kayaking and just relaxing away from it all. If fishing is your thing, then head down to Hastings Beach which offers ample space for boating enthusiasts, with both a public boat launching ramp and a small pay-and-display car park next door.
There's also plenty of choice when it comes to food and drink - with central Wellington having some of the best restaurants in the country, and a handful of award-winning microbreweries making it a destination worth exploring.
The local Wellington brewery scene was born out of necessity in the wake of the earthquakes in March 2016, and it didn't take long for people to flock to these microbreweries and have some fun drinking the freshly made beer. The capital has several craft breweries dotted around the city including Avery's Brewing Company, Mudbrick Brewery and Barley & Spelt.
"The central Wellington area is the epicentre of the creative scene in Wellington," says property agent Lisa Nyman of WPB Real Estate. "It has an artisan culture that is very much present and is a major drawcard to many young artists."
Alongside its rich history and cultural significance, Wellington is the gateway into New

Home/In the News: Mobilizing Military Experience to Support National Security
by Mike Luck, MSJ '07 and Dylan Cramer, CMC '11
Mobilization of military experience is a hallmark of the US National Security Strategy. By drawing on the expertise of trained professionals, policymakers can quickly create, re-create, or repurpose capabilities to meet emerging national security needs. A growing body of evidence indicates mobilized civilian and military experience can be particularly useful to meet the diverse, global security challenges of the 21st century. With this in mind, this paper focuses on mobilization of military experience as it relates to national security. Drawing from the National Research Council's report "Eyelids Up: Do we need a "revolution in military medicine" to keep our troops healthy?"[i] and the National Academies' report on "Very high medical readmission rates among beneficiaries of VA care: is there an operational strategy to address these readmissions?", this article explores the possible role of the medical professional in support of national security.[ii] Drawing on both reports, this article proposes a set of key concepts related to mobilized medical experience as it relates to national security that policymakers should consider. How to make a 3D model of the body from 2D images
Body modeling in computer tomography: do size, shape, and location of the major organs affect the accuracy of 3D models of the body?
Madeleine Schumacher1,
Susan Gollis2 &
Herman P. van der Weele3
Improvements in medical imaging technologies are making it possible to obtain 3D models of the body with increasing precision and reliability. In addition to these advantages, these models are also of great interest for further research into human morphology. However, as the number of available 3D models of the body increases, the question arises: how to ensure the accuracy of the 3D model of the body? To investigate whether or not size, shape, and location of the major organs affect the accuracy of 3D models of the body, we evaluated the accuracy of 3D models of the body using standard quantitative evaluation

<i>no</i>
<i>yes</i> The HELPP Team
HELPP was founded by Dr Markus Thiel in 2013 as an initiative of the University of Cologne. It is a network of public service companies working on behalf of citizens' quality of life and environmental protection as well as of the health care system.
The HELPP Team has 26 members from across Germany. They are representatives of the following institutions:

 8 members from the states of Baden-Württemberg und Bayern
 4 members from North Rhine-Westphalia and 2 members each from Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein
 1 member from the district of Mecklenburg West-Pomerania


A public service company works for the quality of life and the environment of citizens of a particular region and is dependent on public finance for its existence. These public service companies are therefore not dependent on any particular political decision making. On the contrary; it is the public service companies who make decisions and who can and should be involved in political discourses around quality of life and environmental protection. A key focus area of a public service company is health protection and prevention: This is why a team of experts is working at the university of Köln and the HELPP Team is actively contributing towards improving quality of life for citizens in the urban region Köln.

The mouth is one of the body's most important sites for oral immunity. It also serves as a gateway to diabetes and heart disease. But what can you do to keep your mouth healthy this summer?
By: Jennifer Pachucki | Last updated June 12, 2020
Mouth infection is not an infectious disease; it's an inflammatory response in the lining of the mouth. The mouth is home to millions of microorganisms — bacteria, viruses, fungus, and protozoans — some beneficial, others harmful. We don't often think about how these microbes affect our health. Fortunately, the mouth does offer some protection from infections that might otherwise be fatal. Oral immunity means your mouth has some defenses against disease. While inhaled pollutants in the air are the biggest threats to dental health, there are other risk factors, like smoking, so be sure to keep your mouth and gums healthy all year long. Here are seven ways to keep your mouth healthy during the warm weather months:
Drink more water than usual: It may sound obvious, but staying hydrated is important for both your mind and your body. In addition to cooler weather, drinking plenty of water during the summer months helps reduce dry mouth symptoms caused by the lack of moisture in your mouth. It also helps protect your teeth from dental decay. According to research published in The Journal of the American Dental Association, drinking 8 cups of water per day can reduce plaque buildup, which may reduce gingival staining, a red tint of the teeth, and discoloration of the permanent maxillary alveolar bone. Make sure your drinking water contains at least 120 milligrams of fluoride per liter. If your drinking water contains fluoridation residue, your body doesn't need additional fluoride.
Don't smoke: Smoking is a well-known risk factor for serious diseases, like lung cancer and diabetes mellitus, so avoiding cigarette smoke is the best way to protect your mouth from cancer. The risk of cancer from secondhand smoke is often considered equal to that of primary cigarette smoking, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, research shows some differences between smokers and non-smokers. For example, a study conducted by the American College of Prosthodontics showed a statistically significant association between the length of time spent smoking and the likelihood of having dental caries or gingivitis as a child. Children who were around other kids when they were young had significantly fewer caries and gingivitsas adults than kids who were around other adults. In addition, children who didn't have a regular caregiver grew their teeth very differently from children with a regular caregiver. Finally, the adults who grew up in households with a regular caregiver had better oral health than those growing up in homes without a regular caregiver. As a result, it appears the influence of parents on their child's oral health can be lifelong. This research suggests that quitting smoking should be included as part of public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing smoking in movies and advertisements.
Make a habit of flossing daily: A good oral hygiene regimen includes flossing daily. However, many dentists recommend flossing three times per week. It can be tempt

?.?.?. For me, this means getting back to my roots.
Through a process of introspection and rejuvenation, I began to rediscover what made me happy: the creative arts, yoga, and meditation. I am back in the saddle!
In addition to the physical training that came with my career as an elite athlete, I also had a special talent for healing emotional wounds through touch. Now, I am offering these skills as a practicing massage therapist. The HELPP Programme has a number of partnerships which are essential components of its work. Partnerships with local authorities, voluntary sector organisations, community groups and other agencies enable us to provide a range of services, which have a direct impact on people's wellbeing and independence. We also share information and data about how best to meet the needs of people with dementia and their carers, so we can continue to improve services over time.
As part of our commitment to partnership working, we are continually looking at ways to improve the quality of support provided by our partner agencies, so we can meet their identified objectives. In doing so, we will monitor their progress towards meeting agreed targets, measure the success of any initiatives they develop and learn lessons from any failures. As a result, there is continuing work across the programme to identify opportunities for improvements.
In addition to working with our partners, we are committed to developing our own leadership skills and capacity. To enable us to make decisions about the delivery of services, both locally and nationally, we have staff who work in our Dementia Action Team (DAT) office, which is based at Manchester Central Hospital. They work alongside specialist staff within all of our partner organisations, who are responsible for providing day services to people with dementia.
Manchester City Council is the main commissioner for social care in Greater Manchester and is involved in planning services.
Between them, our DAT team provide training and advice on quality assurance, risk assessment and governance, and help deliver the programme's learning and development activity. We also work with other local commissioning bodies to provide support on a range of topics relating to dementia. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor of The 411 Dose Correction Study please contact me directly at pegasus@prn.com or call 877-642-1888 for more details.
The study has begun to recruit patients in an effort to determine the potential effects of dose error corrections in the treatment of cervical cancer.
Patient radiation doses are collected by physicians who are trained in dosimetry.
These dosimeters record the patient's radiation exposure during image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer. As it was announced yesterday morning, the opening of the new 81-storey residential tower of the Prinsengracht tower in Utrecht will be postponed till the fall of 2018. The new complex, which consists of two buildings separated by a pedestrian promenade of 84 meters, is designed as a unique living environment in a green environment. With the high degree of privacy guaranteed inside the buildings, it offers a different living concept for today's rental housing market. The residents will be able to enjoy unspoilt nature right next door.
The Prinsengracht Residence is a result of a collaboration between Bamboo Developments and Utrechtse Houthandel. The design concept was developed together with the residents during the design phase of the project. In addition to the privacy, the residents can benefit from a unique urban location close to the city centre of Utrecht with good accessibility. Bamboo Developments

New England College of Optometry's mission is to educate optometrists who are competent and caring in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of strabismus and amblyopia. The college's focus on service oriented practice requires an understanding of clinical decision making processes, including appropriate use of medications and imaging techniques. It is imperative that optometric students acquire knowledge of the limitations of therapeutic jurisprudence as applied to diabetes mellitus and strabismus. The New England College of Optometry has a history of successful graduating class performance from the Graduate Entry Program. There are over 800 optometry students enrolled at NYU. We have 310 graduates from the Graduate Entry Program who have been practicing optometry for more than five years. The program accepts approximately 75-80 new optometry graduates each year. In addition to providing the theoretical background necessary to become an optometrist, the Graduate Entry Program trains students to think critically about health care issues so they can identify errors in medical care and take action to correct these problems. This is done through case studies, simulations, and hands-on training. Our alumni are practitioners in New York City, Long Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Washington DC and Westchester County, NJ.

New 24-Hour Opioid Hotline Provides Free Support for People Undergoing Treatment for Opioid Addiction
(Los Angeles, CA) – The LA County Caregiver Resource Center announced today it will serve as a hotline to support people undergoing opioid maintenance treatment (MMT) and will be staffed by trained facilitators from 2 p.m. until 2 a.m., seven days per week. This service is in addition to the resources available through LA County Behavioral Health Services including medication-assisted treatment (MAT), medical home care, and family services.
"A hotline addressing the needs of people undergoing opioid maintenance treatment allows for greater support during this difficult time of recovery," stated John Zoghli, Executive Director of the LA Caregiver Resource Center. "Caregivers are often unaware of their own emotional and physical needs as they care for loved ones in opioid treatment. We're committed to serving as a bridge between caregivers and patients in order to improve quality of life and outcomes for both groups."
This new resource is funded by the LA County Board of Supervisors and implemented in partnership with LA Caregiver Resource Center. For more information or to volunteer as a facilitator, call 1-800-818-7879 x 4157.

TURKISH AEGEAN ISLAND CULTURE - HELLENIC CULTURE | PREVIEW | 22 APRIL 2018
Nearly two hundred years ago the Hellenic poet Constantine Cavafy wrote his poetry about Aphrodite and Venus, in a manner similar to Greek antiquity. As we look back to Greek prehistory we find traces of a similar phenomenon: the presence of mythological stories and characters in Homeric texts. This phenomenon is a recurrent one in human history: when stories of the gods are retold by poets or theologians they are adapted to modern audiences and the audiences' understanding of mythology is influenced by current socio

The following are things I've tried. Some worked and others did not work.
I turned off the TV and all the radio stations. It does not happen every day. It happens sometimes at random times during the day. But if you can control how long it waits for you before it reboots, it will work most of the time. If you don't control how long you wait for the reboot, it won't work all of the time. So, you do have some control over this problem.
Go into the Settings menu. Find the reboot option there. Click on it. Under the "reboot when..." heading, click "Yes" if you want the computer to restart each time a specific program crashes. It is well documented that laparoscopic myomectomy results in significant symptomatic and functional benefits. But is laparoscopic myomectomy as safe and effective as open myomectomy? This is an important question since laparoscopic myomectomy carries the additional risk of postoperative adverse events such as nausea and vomiting. Is it worthwhile performing laparoscopic myomectomy in low-risk populations? Unfortunately, the answer to both questions remains unanswered. The following review of the current literature aims to address these questions by evaluating the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic myomectomy from a broad surgical perspective.
Critical Care Research Group (CCRG) and The Cancer Centre (TCC) of the Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, performed systematic reviews of the medical literature relating to myomatous liver disease and potential effects of chemotherapy using PubMed and EMBASE databases.
Three reviewers independently searched the medical literature for articles relevant to myomas and/or liver cancer. Articles were included if they met the inclusion criteria: myomas >0 cm size and/or the presence of at least one metastasis from an unknown head and neck origin; patients with hereditary spherocytosis who received adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy; patients with head and neck cancer receiving adjuvant M-VEC

user is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis? A good and healthy lifestyle is key to a long life, and so it is important to follow the rules of prevention when it comes to cancer. Is there any cancer risk for people with diabetes mellitus? Yes: people with diabetes are at increased cancer risk. Cancer risk for people with diabetes is about twice as high as the risk for non-diabetic population.
 the risk for some types of cancer is increased by up to threefold in diabetic subjects, depending on whether it was estimated from a population study or an individual case study. With the help of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, we were able to make sure there weren't any differences in stroke patients' home environments compared to patients' work environments. Home and Work Environment: Does It Make a Difference?
 70% had home environments with strokes; 14% had strokes in their home environments; 25% had strokes in both home and work environments; and 33% had strokes in neither home nor work environments. In 1978 I attended my first Blessing of the Animals service with my mother-in-law. As a Catholic who doesn't believe in religion per se, but believes in God and his son Jesus Christ, I felt very strongly about animals during that time of my life.
It has been my dream ever since to become a Veterinarian! And every time I walk past a stray cat or dog that needs medical attention, I want to be able to give it. Even though we're living in an area where there are tons of pets already, we still have plenty of strays around here. There are so many homeless cats and dogs here that the local animal shelter sometimes has too many. One way to help these animals that are in need is to donate money towards food and veterinary care. It's amazing how just a little bit goes such a long way toward providing food and medicine to sick or injured animals.
I was raised a Catholic and love the Lord dearly. We even have an animal chapel at our parish church. I also love animals and am committed to helping them when they're in need. It was an awesome feeling to be able to bless animals the very first time I did one here in my hometown. It was amazing to see hundreds of people come out to bless dogs, cats, and birds… and most importantly animals like horses, which seem to elicit so much emotion in humans! Animals are so precious and valuable to us all.
I have always wanted to be able to make a difference in someone's life, not only for them, but especially for those less fortunate than me. I think animals provide a lot of comfort to many people who are struggling to survive, and it would be wonderful if we could continue to help them in times of need.
I had the opportunity recently to witness firsthand the effects of this community service through my employer, the Humane Society of Ventura County. Their animals are taken from places like shelters and rescues, and I have seen firsthand the difference they can make for a few dollars spent to support their cause. Everyone I know that volunteers for the HSVC knows the benefits they receive from helping an animal find homes and get back into the community.
Many times the need is so great, volunteering can mean the difference between life and death for a pet. We have been asked to help pets with diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and a whole host of other medical problems. Some people have been asked to vaccinate animals to protect them against certain diseases. While you might not agree with each and everyone request to volunteer, I challenge you to consider what you could offer your neighbors, friends, family, co-workers, and pets. "Knowledge is not power in a clinical setting without the ability to act upon it," writes Dr. Gery Gannon, a family physician in a rural community in Northwest Ontario.

Health literacy: are doctors meeting the needs of patients who don't read or understand medical information? The Piedmont region of California encompasses parts of three counties: Butte, Plumas and Sierra. The region is known for its unique combination of warmth and cool climate, with distinct flora and fauna. It's known for its diversity of landscape, including the High Sierra and Coast Range mountain ranges. Here are ten Piedmont things to do when visiting the region.

Does the US want a military confrontation with Russia in Syria?
The US-Russian confrontation over Syria is the result of a deepening mutual distrust and is not a spontaneous reaction to the recent use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad's government. This is a new type of military confrontation: it is a clash between two militaries capable of projecting force globally, without an international ground operation. We are looking at a possible use of force against another country without the benefit of a mandate from the UN Security Council, with the active participation of US forces in the initial phase and their withdrawal in subsequent phases of the conflict.
The main argument for the US to launch an attack on the Assad regime remains to support the moderate opposition. After US Secretary of State John Kerry's trip to Turkey and Qatar in early July, the US has intensified its air strikes in Syria, while its political role in this military intervention will be limited to its delivery of munitions and logistical support to Kurdish groups. However, the main reason for Washington to attack the Assad regime is that the latter uses chemical weapons against civilians. Therefore, a major reason for the US's desire to fight against the Assad regime is to prevent the use of chemical weapons by other countries in future.
Thus, the US seeks to avoid the establishment of a permanent military presence in Syria after the defeat of the Islamic State group. The Assad regime is expected to continue using chemical weapons in the future, which means that Washington has to avoid a military confrontation with Moscow as far as possible. But does Washington's desire to avoid direct military confrontations in Syria lead it to accept the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime? To date, Washington has been consistent about its anti-chemical weapons position: "no" to chemical warfare and "no" to the use of chemical weapons.
Is the US seeking to avoid a direct military confrontation with Moscow in Syria?
However, there are indications that Washington is planning to attack Syria if Russia continues to support Damascus's ally Hezbollah in the future, which would mean the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian army against the Shiite militias near the Lebanese border. The Assad regime will certainly try to avoid any confrontation with Hezbollah in light of the US's recent escalation of its military activities against Iran's Shia proxy, particularly the attack of August 4, which led to the death of 218 people in the city of Latakia, including many Hezbollah militants.
Assad's regime hopes to make the United States understand that he needs Hezbollah's support in Syria and to avoid a possible military confrontation in the future. Accordingly, the American administration has announced several times that it would provide intelligence support and logistical backing for the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria. In exchange, Damascus expects Washington to avoid a direct military confrontation and to remove the regime's main enemy in Syria - Hezbollah - from its borders.
However, this expectation seems to have no weight with the US administration: Washington

The New England Patriots took over the Super Bowl lead in the first half of the second quarter Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons, but the deficit was so large it wasn't even close as Tom Brady threw three interceptions in his first two playoff games since 2008. It was enough for Atlanta to pull within four points at halftime after the Patriots converted three third downs and a fourth-quarter field goal. Even with two defensive touchdowns in the fourth quarter, Atlanta couldn't make up the seven-point deficit. The Falcons fell to 1-2 in the divisional round of the playoffs while the Patriots are now 5-0 in the divisional round.
Brady threw an interception on Atlanta's first possession, followed by another pick late in the second quarter. In addition to the three picks, he had two sacks. Brady has thrown five interceptions in each of the last two playoffs after throwing nine all season long. He said there's only one way he can win and that's by not turning the ball over.
Patriots players and coaches said the first half performance made them anxious heading into the second half when Atlanta made a charge in the second quarter. In the first half, the Patriots defense allowed the Falcons to convert three third downs. In the second half, Atlanta fumbled twice and lost both times.
While the Patriots defense forced multiple turnovers, the offense couldn't maintain momentum and eventually was shutout in the fourth quarter. The Patriots finished 3-for-13 on third downs and were held without a single first down in the second half.
Matt Patricia said his defense kept the Falcons from turning the ball over which gave his team a chance to stay in the game. The Falcons had five total turnovers compared to five Patriot turnovers during the season.

For centuries, humans have been using and modifying natural products for medicinal purposes. In fact, one study found that of the top 200 pharmaceutical substances identified in human breast milk, at least a third contained active ingredients derived from plants. Today, the use of plant-based medicines is gaining acceptance among both Western and non-Western cultures.

The Guardian has a story entitled 'Leading the way on lead poisoning: is there any evidence of a childhood lead hazard?' about Lance Gowing, from the Natural History Museum, who has been instrumental in developing international guidance on lead exposure in drinking water. The article quotes Gowing saying, 'protective action should be taken against lead poisoning in children's blood' and reports that, as part of the lead programme at the Natural History Museum, he was working with the World Health Organization and the European Union. I found some information about this programme when looking for background information to report on in a recent posting., Lance Gowing and the lead programme at the Natural History Museum, in connection with child health hazards (1984-2014) which is now published in my PhD thesis:
 'Lead poisoning in drinking water: potential for a childhood lead hazard?'.
 In the course of my thesis research, I came across the following paragraph in one of Dr Gowing's reports; "we have the potential to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children's blood by: 1) reducing the levels of lead in drinking water 2) monitoring lead in children's blood for early identification of lead poisoning". Cutting Edge Surgical Instrumentation is pleased to announce our new product line, the RotaTeq CLASS™ system. This surgical tool system includes 50 surgical instruments designed to enable high quality internal carotid artery crossing (ICA) for arterial reconstruction in chronic stroke patients with spasticity, to avoid major arteries (MA) and therefore reduce technical risk and long-term costs.
The RotaTeq CLASS™ system is designed to meet the needs of both stroke patients and stroke caregivers, while reducing both patient and caregiver risks associated with arterial reconstruction. It was developed based upon a clinically verified system in the Netherlands.
RotoTeq CLASS™ is the first commercially available system to enable ICA reconstruction for chronic stroke patients with spasticity, using low risk instruments in a high risk environment.

We live in an area where there aren't many trails, so we decided to take advantage of a good weekend day for a little family run. I was running and jogging behind her the entire time. I have to say she did an excellent job on her birthday run. She didn't even complain once after her long run!!
We had to walk around a bit and look for a few things, but other than that it was a really nice run! You can actually see the beach in the distance and get a feel

. Are all the animals in New York City endangered?
 if so then are there more dangerous wild animals than the less dangerous domesticated ones?
 if no then they are, and if yes then it does seem that New York City is, but not always, a great place for endangered wildlife to live?
 if all the wild animals in New York City are endangered? if so why?

 if there are more endangered wildlife in New York City than in the United States as whole?  if so then perhaps it's time to reconsider the wisdom of the "Nickel Rule"—the idea that people should be charged at least two nickels per gallon when they visit state parks (since 1983)?

If you're in a position where you have to choose between working hard and working smart, you may be surprised by the results of a recent study that determined the relationship between working hard and working smart. It turns out that working hard isn't really what matters; it's the difference between working smart and working dumb. If you want to see real results from your efforts, consider getting help with your tax preparation from tax experts who are well trained in both the law and the computer systems used to file taxes. They know exactly what types of deductions and credits are worthwhile, and how to apply them most effectively.
Tax experts are also the best people to answer questions about filing your own tax return. For example, there are certain items that you'll need to claim for yourself rather than your spouse or children. But before claiming these items, check to make sure you're doing everything you're legally allowed to do. Working smart means working smarter and harder and then checking those deductions against the law. It's a lot easier to get qualified tax help from experts, like the ones at Tax Time Online.

There is a common misconception among first-time homebuyers that it is an easy and straightforward process – and unfortunately, many new homeowners quickly discover just how wrong they were! In fact, buying a house can be one of the most confusing and daunting financial decisions made by people their entire lives – and it is a decision that takes careful consideration and planning. With the right resources, however, you can avoid many of the biggest mistakes first-timers make while purchasing a home. So keep reading below and you will be well on your way to becoming a confident homeowner!
Is buying a house really cheaper than renting?
The short answer is no. Apartment rental costs in some markets are much lower than the average mortgage payment – and this trend is expected to continue into 2019 and beyond! However, there are several factors that can make apartment renting significantly cheaper than buying a home; these factors include, but are not limited to, rental prices, local tax laws, and even transportation costs! And these factors are only likely to increase over time. So when comparing costs, look closely at every cost listed, and remember that in almost every city and state, buying a home will actually end up being much more expensive than renting.
The reality is that a homebuyer's debt-to-income ratio is often significantly higher than a borrower's mortgage-to-income ratio. That said, in order to qualify for a mortgage, the loan-to-value ratio must be under 80%. However, if you buy a house with less than 80% LTV, your debt-to-income ratio will be dramatically higher than 80%, which will force you to use equity in your house to pay off your credit card bill each month. Unfortunately, this may not work in your favor – because your credit score will take a major hit and will most certainly negatively affect your application for a mortgage. Thus, instead of worrying about the math behind your LTV number, focus on keeping your total household deb

46-year-old woman who got pregnant from rape is now a mother to two children
SPECIAL CITY REPORT-A pregnant woman who got her partner's semen by rape in her uterine tract is now a mother to two children.
Katharine (last name withheld for privacy reasons) is an adult woman who got pregnant after being raped during her 2nd trimester in her uterine tract. She is currently receiving medical treatment from her local counseling center, and she is now working at home with her two children. She was raped when she was 17 years old. At the time of her first pregnancy, she had to endure sexual assault because of her low socioeconomic status and lack of resources to protect herself. Her case demonstrates how an unintended pregnancy with sexual assault can have lasting effects on survivors, as well as how this case is indicative of how women living in poverty and the working poor are often invisible in the data collected about sexual violence.
Rape victims are often invisible in the data collected about sexual assaults
Recovery and relapse rates are notoriously underreported in sexual assault cases
Do we need more services for survivors of sexual assault who are in recovery or relapse? No!
I was raped 10 months ago, and I am now pregnant with my 3rd child
When do survivors of sexual assault need more mental health services?
In addition to psychological trauma, survivors of sexual assault also experience emotional trauma, in addition to PTSD symptoms. Recovery and relapse rates are notoriously underreported in sexual assault cases. In this study, we looked at the recovery and relapse rates for survivors of sexual assault in our local community, and compared them to other populations such as people who have been sexually victimized as children. We also wanted to determine if there were differences in recovery and relapse rates between survivors of sexual assault who are in recovery or relapses, based on their characteristics, including age, marital status, whether they have children, and their level of education.
The results of this study indicate that sexual assault survivors who are in recovery have higher rates of both relapses and recovery than survivors who are not in recovery. We also found a slight difference in recovery and relapses between survivors who are in recovery and survivors who are relapses, suggesting that whether a survivor relapses after a sexual assault depends on factors outside of their control. This suggests that survivors who are relapses may need more support from sexual assault service providers to achieve long-term recovery and decrease relapses.
Based on our research, do survivors of sexual assault often fall off the surveillance radar after an assault? NO!
Do more services for survivors of sexual assault lead to fewer relapses? Maybe!
Do more services for survivors of sexual assault result in lower rates of relapses? no!
Are more services for survivors of sexual assault likely to reduce the rates of relapses? no!
Are these results indicative of survival patterns among sexual assault survivors?no!
Do socioeconomic differences exist in survival patterns among sexual assault survivors?no!
Is there a relationship between socioeconomic status and recovery outcomes among sexual assault survivors?no!
Are there any differences in relapse rates among survivors depending on their marital status?yes!
Survivor characteristics were related to recovery outcomes among sexual assault survivors, with women who are in relapse more likely to be lapsed men. However, sexual assault survivors who are relapses less likely to relapses than survivors who are relapses. The relationship between socioeconomic status and survival outcomes among sexual assault survivors who are relapses is unclear, but this has implications for women surviving sexual assault without medical insurance.
The study's findings also provide information that will help sexual assault service providers

Elephant Court is located on the north side of Chesterfield, Missouri. and is immediately west of Interstate Highway I-70. The site offers a number of unique features which have created strong demand among potential site users. These include: excellent highway access; excellent airport proximity, less than ten miles southwest of Lambert St. Louis International Airport; proximity to two public housing projects; high-end commercial real estate located adjacent to the site; a long-standing history of manufacturing and industrial activity; and a rich history of rail and freight transportation in the area. Elephant Court is considered a prime site for redevelopment, with great opportunity for multi-family residential construction, hotel/motel development, and other forms of employment based development.
"We believe this is an ideal site for an urban mixed-use environment with new, energy efficient buildings. Our goal is to develop this community as quickly as possible in order to benefit our residents as well as those traveling through Chesterfield," commented Brian Voss, Vice President of Development, Foster + Partners. The master plan proposes to provide quality residential apartments, a variety of shops and restaurants, and recreational facilities including ball fields, tennis courts, and parks. A public park will also feature artistic landscaping, walkways, ponds, and fountains. Wanted to pass along the information that I saw yesterday while shopping at Walgreens.

Does anyone know the store where you can pick one up? The Slow Cooker is an indispensible kitchen appliance. Whether you're making soup or burgers, the slow cooker saves time by cooking on low for 8 hours, and then resting for another 8. It's perfect for when you want flavourful food without adding tons of fat. However, one of the biggest drawbacks of using your slow cooker is the smell of cooking meat, particularly pork. Thankfully, with some ingenuity, you can use your slow cooker to reduce this smelly waste. Read on to discover 13 ways to make your slow cooker cleaner and healthier.
The smell of cooked meat can be overwhelming to some people. When eating out, people often feel the need to ask their server if the meat was cooked to a specific temperature. Sometimes it can be difficult to determine what is wrong with the meat in question. After all, who really wants a burger served with onions and mushrooms floating around in the meat? With the right technique, however, you can enjoy your slow cooker more, while still getting delicious, healthy meals. Here are some tips to clean your slow cooker so that you can enjoy all the smoky flavours it produces without having to deal with the stink of cooked meat.
It's not always necessary to spray your slow cooker every time you add something to it. For example, I rarely use my crockpot after a meal since I already know what is going into my slow cooker before I start cooking. But some things just need a little extra care so you don't end up smelling aromatic food for several days!
If your slow cooker doesn't have a lid for stews, soups, or sauces, cover them up with aluminum foil. This not only prevents food from sticking, but also helps reduce odor by trapping warm air inside your slow cooker and reducing heat loss.
Do you ever add salt to your slow cooker? If so, it's important to let it sit out of the refrigerator for a few hours before adding the salt to reduce salty food odors. Otherwise,

The 2018 Punjab legislative session has begun in the Indian State of Punjab with a flurry of activity. The Government of Punjab, led by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, has been busy during the 16th Session of the Assembly and will continue its work into February 2018 when the next round of elections will be held in the province. One of the key events of the first week of proceedings was the first reading of the Punjab Veterinary Services Bill, 2018 which, in its current version, seeks to strengthen veterinary services in the State.
The draft legislation seeks to establish the office of a Deputy Director General within the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in the State of Punjab and assign him/her the responsibility of overseeing and coordinating all veterinary activities across the Province. It will also empower the State Government through an Additional Duties Order to appoint 22 additional Veterinary Service Officers in addition to the 55 currently existing under Section 3A of the Punjab Veterinary and Animal Sciences University Act, 2012. These Officers, called Vet Officers, would serve as additional duties to the regular Veterinary Service Officers. There is no mention in the legislation regarding the role

 Advertisements in the form of endorsing articles are a new and growing ad type. It's part of an emerging trend in advertising and one that seems to be associated with older adults who are more likely than their younger counterparts to have disabilities and/or health care coverage. (Eyelid loss is a very common facial disfigurement; about half of people affected by the disease are under 65 years old.) This ad type might appeal to older adults because it has the appearance of a scholarly research study and is targeted at a group of potential customers who might want information about aging and possible solutions for common problems. We used Advertisements in Textbooks: Does Their Placement in High School English Textbooks Sell Influence? as an opportunity to investigate this ad type further.

By Jeff Dekker, January 28th 2016
A new level of innovation for walking machines? We review a dyson treadmill for running with precision. Does it meet the needs of professional athletes? Let us find out.
by Jeff Dekker | Jan 27th 2016 | Innovation, Running, Sport, Treadmill, training, Weight loss | 5 comments
Do machines, like dysons, make more sense than humans when it comes to walking? Is there any evidence that machines can help professional athletes train better? This article will examine the innovative dyson treadmill for running and find out if it is a great tool for running with precision.
Dyson is a British brand that has become very popular in the United States due to its innovative products. The company produces tools and devices such as dyson vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, and other appliances. The company also manufactures dyson treadmills.
Are Dyson treadmills superior to conventional ones?
Is the dyson treadmill better at running with precision than traditional running shoes?
Are dysons different from standard running shoes in terms of impact forces?
Is there a difference in energy expenditure while running with a dyson treadmill compared to running without a dyson treadmill?
Are dysons accurate enough to measure precise running speed?
Can dysons improve running speed over standard running shoes?
Is the dyson treadmill safe and effective for running speed training?
Can dysons predict running speed accurately during training?
Are dysons worth the price tag?
1 Are Dyson treadmills superior to standard running shoes?
2 Is the dyson treadmill different from standard running shoes in terms of impact forces?
3 Can a dyson treadmill accurately predict running speed?
4 Are dyson treadmills safe and effective for running speed training?
5 Can a dyson treadmill improve running speed over standard running shoes?
6 Is a dyson treadmill worth the price tag?
A new level of innovation for walking machines? We review a dyson treadmill for running with precision. Does it meet the needs of professional athletes? Let us find out.
The dyson treadmill is designed specifically for running purposes. It is easy to use and requires little to no training to begin running on it. The machine's design enables the athlete to run at a variety of speeds, from slow to fast.
Due to its portability, the dyson treadmill can be easily taken along with an athlete during travel or even during off-season training cycles. Once home, the athlete can plug the machine into a standard outlet and get right back into their regular running routine.
Is the dyson treadmill more accurate than standard running shoes in terms of impact force measurement?
The dyson treadmill was designed for running purposes. It measures running speed in response to external stimuli, so its accuracy depends upon the accuracy of the stimulus source.
While standard running shoes provide information about running speed using only the foot's surface area, the dyson treadmill measures running speed based upon a combination of surface area and shape. This means that the accuracy of the stimulus source determines the accuracy of the dyson treadmill, which could affect running speed training results.
Is there a difference between the dyson treadmill and standard running shoes in terms of impact forces? Nope.
The dyson treadmill is designed with high impact resistance in mind. Its special sole design reduces fatigue and increases running speed.
Is the dyson treadmill safe and effective for running speed training? Yes! Its special sole design makes it one of the most efficient and accurate treadmills available. It provides consistent running speed with minimal variability

The A-768 is a three-line (6+1) VLF/UHF preamplifier designed to provide superior performance at modest cost. This high current design provides up to 7 amps of continuous power per line into a wide variety of receivers. The A-768 is based on the popular A-758 VLF/UHF preamp. While it uses a three-line amplifier structure similar to most three-line amplifiers, the A-768 uses a special low-noise power supply for superior audio reproduction in an economy design. All A-768 lines offer 8 dB input gain before loss while preserving excellent linearity. With a simple two-conductor external ground bus terminal, the A-768 can operate from any power source while maintaining maximum power handling capability.
The A-768 is offered as a three-line, non-isolated preamplifier or in an isolated version with internal power supply. Isolation between the three-line outputs and the internal power supplies eliminates both EMI noise and common-mode harmonic distortion. The A-768 is optimized for use with an external power supply or an internal power supply that feeds either line. All three lines of the A-768 can operate in the same mode, independent of the selected output path. In addition, all three lines have an input impedance of less than 2 kOhms making this device ideal for VLF/UHF receivers designed using an internal power supply or with a third phase. These internal phase-locked loops can then operate without the additional loading provided by the A-768.
The A-768 is an active device operating from ±2 VDC to +30 VDC and from -40° to +70°C with an output voltage of +/- 2.4 V. A typical A-768 may require two batteries: one to power the internal positive feedback loops and one to power the internal negative feedback loops. I have been thinking about this question recently as I have been looking at the evidence relating to diabetes and chronic low back pain. Is there an association between these two types of pain? Could the evidence suggest some sort of causality relationship between the two? My first answer was no, however I recently came across a study that suggests otherwise

pterygium syndrome
pterygium carcinoma Duty is one of the most significant and demanding duties an officer can be assigned. The basic concept of duty as it relates to the police officer is the same one the army officer serves; however, the responsibilities of the police officer are different from those of the military officer. The police officer is often required to perform duties while on patrol and is expected to fulfill his or her responsibilities to ensure public safety. Although officers are required to uphold the laws of the state and maintain public order and safety, they are also required to work with the community to solve problems and improve neighborhood conditions. As such, police officers are often called upon to make arrests and perform other enforcement duties, which can have a profound impact on their daily lives and that of their families.

The National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) represents the interests of over 160,000 law enforcement officers across the United States. NAPO provides officers with education, training, and advocacy opportunities in addition to serving as a voice for public safety issues on Capitol Hill. NAPO's mission is to advance the public safety mission by protecting and serving the communities of law enforcement officers nationwide. Foster Carer

LOS ANGELES — Following yesterday's WNBA All-Star Game at Staples Center, the National Basketball Association's women's division returns today as Team USA takes on Italy in their opening round game of the WNBA Playoffs. NBC will air tonight's games beginning with the WNBA All-Star Game at 7:30 p.m. ET followed by the women's tournament and the semifinal game at 10 p.m. ET. Team USA will play in their third consecutive women's basketball tournament as the reigning champion.

Led by 15-year WNBA veteran Lisa Leslie, Team USA features seven current or former professional basketball players, including 2008 Olympic gold medalist Sue Bird and Olympic gold medalist Chamique Holdsclaw.

The WNBA Playoffs begin Thursday, Aug. 17 with Team USA playing Canada at Los Angeles Clippers' Staples Center. Mildred Fawcett
Mildred Fawcett (1888-1968) was an avid reader during her long retirement, but her life changed when she discovered that, at seventy-two, it was possible to learn something new every day! That discovery led to thousands of hours of listening and learning, and she taught herself to read and write English. The result of these lifelong activities was her publication of the book, "A Woman's Wisdom," which includes 3,270 quotes from more than 2,800 authors. Mildred died in 1968 at the age of ninety-one. Her children published her collected works in 2008, and they are now available online. This post about her includes some information about the publication and availability of her work online, plus a little bit about her life.
Mildred Fawcett was born Mary Ann Wood on March 4, 1888 in England. In her later years she had lived mostly in New York City, but she spent much of her working life in England. She married Harold Fawcett in 1913 and the two retired from active duty in 1958. As a couple they travelled extensively, meeting with some successes and some setbacks along the way. They left New York for Florida in 1961, and then moved to Arizona fourteen years later. Harold passed away in 1981.
In her twilight years Mildred enjoyed some success in the world of publishing. Her book, "Sentimentalists and Their Friends: An Anthology of 800 Sentiments" was first published in 1964, then again in 2008. Each copy of this book sold out shortly after its initial printing. It has become a modern classic in both its printed version and its Kindle version.

 GERD2 - European Groundwater Model
 (H)

 GERD2 is a European groundwater model suitable for regional hydrogeology, with emphasis on the interaction between different aquatic and non-aquatic environments. GERD2 provides for a dynamic representation of the interactions among aquatic and non-aquatic environments. This model is based on a multidisciplinary approach to groundwater hydrology. GERD2 has been implemented in the Dutch hydraulic network NUTRIANS and currently in a version for regional use in the Netherlands, Belgland and France. This regional model is suitable for regional hydrogeological studies.
GRED2 is designed to provide an integrated representation of the hydrogeological process, i. from an hydrogeological point of view, i. from an environment and aquatic point of view. from an ecological point of view as well as from a regional perspective. In GRED2 we are able to provide information on hydrogeological processes and their influence on groundwater quality and quantity for the entire NUTRIANS subcatchment in a region, using a spatially explicit modelling approach.
Both from an regional perspective and from an environmental perspective information about the use of freshwater resources can be provided. Home » Newspapers » "Eastern Front" in "Echo of Moscow" newspaper (1985-1986): "fascist" or "right-wing extremist"?
Newspapers of the 70s-80s of the last century published articles critical of Soviet authorities. The "Echo of Moscow" newspaper was a particularly aggressive outlet, as its publisher V.P. Chernovsky showed when he answered the question: "Is 'Echo of Moscow' newspaper a fascist or a right-wing extremist publication?" His answer: "no" (Chernovsky 1984). In his opinion, "Echo of Moscow" was neither "a fascist nor a right-wing extremist magazine," but a "fascistic and an extreme nationalist publication."
He then proceeded to describe its content and its impact on society during the glasnost period. Why is there no HIV/STD control program in San Francisco?
May 28th, 2010 by Kate Raines
Ever wonder why San Francisco doesn't have a public health system that protects the citizens of our city from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? If you thought maybe it had something to do with high cost of living, think again! It turns out that we don't even have a public health department to administer these programs. We depend instead on a few small local agencies–some of which were cut back years ago–and on the Department of Public Health Services, a state agency that was once an important player in preventing sexually transmitted infections in California but has been largely dismantled. While many communities around the country do have comprehensive STD control programs in place, one of the largest cities in the nation does not. And without a major focus on public health, it seems likely we won't have a major response to one of America's most pressing public health issues any time soon.

Learning About Michigan's Natural Resources and Their Benefits
Do children learn more when they take an active role in conservation projects? In May of 2012, Michigan's Natural Areas Program teamed up with Outdoor School, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing science education in a hands-on manner. Their goal was to teach students how natural areas support biodiversity, including plants, animals, and human activities. Outdoor School's curriculum is used by 400 schools across the state and serves 8,000 students every year. By working together, the Natural Areas Program and Outdoor School were able to reach students all over the state.
Two-year-old Dylan, an outdoors enthusiast, began learning about Michigan's natural resources while visiting a wildlife rehabilitation center in mid-Michigan called Blessings Wildlife Center. Outdoor School volunteers visited the center and built relationships with the staff and patients so that the children would understand the importance of protecting wildlife habitat. They taught Dylan the basics of

The Lights Have Shone Brighter Since 2002...
July 9th, 2008, marked the fifth anniversary of the murder of 21-year old Troy Davis at the hands of state trooper Michael Berlon in Savannah, Georgia. In the years since his execution, it became clear that the state troopers were lying about Davis' guilt while also committing numerous procedural violations during his trial and subsequent execution. It was also clear after Davis' execution that these violations were being committed not only by state troopers but also other agents employed by the state. Yet instead of investigating any of these alleged violations, which would surely have resulted in an immediate appeal of Davis' death sentence, the Georgia Governor and Attorney General refused to investigate the violations and instead issued an official statement congratulating the state police on their "improvements" made since Davis' death in 2008.
While Davis' execution was initially suspended on account of several unexplained delays and violations during his final process in the courtroom, it finally went forward as scheduled. As a result, his case was the most high profile executed in recent history, with thousands in attendance to witness his death as well as his incarcerated ex-partner John Huggins. Davis' execution, which is notorious among his supporters as a public safety issue, received extensive media coverage, with Davis' father, mother, and brother all speaking out against the state's use of capital punishment.
Since 2008, the state has increased its execution rate, despite the fact that death penalty statistics show that states with more executions more often execute dangerous murderers than those with fewer executions more often execute less dangerous murderers. During the first seven months of 2013, the state of Georgia executed nine people - three of whom had been on death row for more than 15 years - compared to five people executed during the same time period last year. Additionally, since 2008, over half of the people executed nationwide have been sentenced to death by juries.
During the past sixteen years, numerous issues have been raised regarding the use of capital punishment by the Georgia government including a significant number of technical errors during Davis' execution. Despite these procedural violations and the continued use of the death penalty in the state, the state's support of capital punishment has not changed. In August of 2011, then-Attorney General Thurbert E. Baker argued against the abolition of the death penalty at a state court level. He stated: "[t]he death penalty continues to deter crime by sentencing killers to die." This is a position shared by former governor Nathan Deal who in 2008 publicly vowed to "continue to fight to keep the death penalty alive" citing

 QUICK CORRECTIONS TO THE U.S. SPECIFICALLY ADMINISTERED VEHICLESTER PROGRAM FOR THE RELEASE OF PRIVATE INFORMATION

I read your article "Quick correction to the U.S. specifically administered vehiclesterm program for the release of private information" and was surprised to learn that this program does not exist; and I am curious if the US Department of State has any involvement in the distribution of this particular information to the general public via your article.  
the U.S. department of State has no official role in administering the vehicle registry, nor has its program been funded by the US Congress or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  http://www.registry.dot.gov/about_the_vehicle_database/faq/index.shtml 

A: "I have just gotten some great news about my son's car accident: he wasn't injured in the accident; there were only minor physical symptoms; and he walked away from the crash without a scratch. (he also had a minor mechanical failure, which the car manufacturer agreed to pay for) His car will not cost him a dime and his insurance company won't cost him a cent. His medical bills will go down significantly and his injuries are non-disabling--but they are debilitating to say the least.  It's true the the insurance companies often deny coverage on these sorts of claims because of their financial loss at the time of the accident. (but they're willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle these sorts of cases) 
The lawsuits against the auto companies are a waste of time and money.  I don't believe the auto companies would settle if there wasn't a big payout coming down the road.
If you've never read them, look up the Treadmill Test in 40 different publications and see how it affects people who are injured in car accidents.  If you are injured in a car accident, ask your physician about the Treadmill Test. It can save you tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills.  It's not just one person's experience. The tests show a huge range of responses depending on whether it's done by someone with a computer or someone with manual controls.  Your doctor might not know about the test unless he/she is reading it in various journals like the Medical Economist and the Journal of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy.  There are different types of tests, including whether they are performed by a physician or a nurse.  Some are performed while driving a car, others while sitting at home on the couch.  Some tests are done in various ways--including standing on tiptoes and walking on unsteady legs.  All of these are good indicators of possible ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, a major cause of spondylolysis in adolescents, and other forms of mechanical dysfunction in kids who are already spondylally dysfunctional, many of whom develop chronic low back pain later in life.  This test should be mandatory in all state run personal injury claims processing systems.

"Anna was on point with me the entire time I was in the water. She encouraged me to push past my comfort zone and help others, too," says Devin, an LMU junior who swam with his teammates in the 2018 Los Angeles City Championship 4×100 free relay. "She's a tremendous role model."
'SPEED UP'
Their friendship started at USC, where Devin was a four-time All-American with the Trojans men's swim team from 2012-16. The first time he met Anna was a few minutes before her first race ever, at USC's 500-meter breaststroke at NCAA Championships, where she placed ninth. They were the same age, and Devin immediately liked her style.
"I was surprised and shocked that she wasn't a freshman like me," says Devin, who was 33 years old when they graduated college. "That gave me more fuel for the fire because I thought,'maybe she'll make me push harder.'"
Devin, who majored in mechanical engineering, had to adjust to a different type of speed. His body didn't respond to the demands of college athletics like it used to: a major difference between men's and women's swimming teams.
"You don't always need to push the pace," explains Devin, who works at LAMDA, a nonprofit research institute in Pasadena, Calif. "For example, it's a lot easier to swim fast in 100 yards than it is in 400 meters or 100 meters. You're just running around in circles."
But Anna, who majored in public health, knew there was a way to help. As a graduate student in the early 2000s, she spent two summers working as a camp counselor at the Boys & Girls Club of Long Beach. She recalls one summer when a 9-year-old camper came back after an afternoon pool break in tears.
"He told us what he did during the break. He had no shoes on his feet! He told us how he'd run around in circles in the middle of his bedroom, with only shoes on his feet!" recalls Anna. "'How could anyone sleep at night knowing this?' asked another camper.
The camper's mom had heard these sorts of stories repeatedly at the Boys & Girls Club. With this new perspective, Anna started wondering why other parents weren't asking their kids if they were wearing shoes at night. "Is this really normal?" she wondered. Anna wanted to know whether kids could be motivated to wear shoes all night long.
A 48-hour period of testing the idea began to formulate in her mind. She recruited 11 boys ages 7-10 to try running around in circles naked without shoes for 48 hours straight. "They did it! Every single one of them did it!" says Anna. Her son, Devin, agreed to help. "Are you sure it was a good idea?" asked Devin. "Yes, absolutely!" replied Anna. So Devin began the next project.
"We decided to do a study on laziness among high school sophomores. Are they really lazy? No. Maybe 8 percent of them are? Maybe? No? We've got to find out. It's the first time anyone's done anything about this," she says. Anna and Devin began a 10-day survey sent home to students in Santa Monica High School, which found 3 percent of sophomore girls and 8 percent of sophomore boys were lazy at lunch.
"What about sports participation? Are soccer players and basketball players any slower than the average athlete? It's just a difference in frequency of participation," explains Anna. "Maybe it's a matter of

error user What's new album "The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of" is full of amazing tracks, with lots of good beats and great hooks. Is there any kind of message in it all the way through or just a collection of songs that happen to sound similar?
no message at all, other than it's really fuckin' great music!
 What a lot of people seem to forget is that the world is only as dark as you make it. There's no "end" to the process of depression and anxiety; it's a long term illness that can be treated successfully, and it can be fought back. And that is what this album is about: a collection of songs to lift ones spirits, for those who can't fight depression alone. How does it end? I'll let you find out for yourself by listening to the album, but here's my take: "What's It All You Look Like", in which Calexico makes a call-to-action for all those who suffer from mental illnesses: "if we can make a stand against the ignorance and pain, then maybe our country will start to change".
 If there were ever an epitaph to Calexico's music and lyrics, these are it, an album made up of the good things in life and the bad. But don't forget, sometimes good things get taken away too, like this world, so let's make sure they always have their own corner of heaven.
Glad to see another great, honest review for this album from The Wrong Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of...
I can only speak for myself of course, but there has not been one song on this album I haven't loved (and I have listened to it about two dozen times now). In fact, there aren't even any filler songs (not sure how to describe the opening and closing songs in particular) — just really good, great music! This album is a joyful journey from start to finish. And that ending? Wowza! What an ending to a fantastic album! And I can't wait for the follow-up!
Thanks so much for the thoughtful write-up, the Wrong Stuff That Dreams Are Made of...!! :)

In NYC, car ownership is on the decline, but the car-as-a-convenience-item is very much a part of urban life.
Are car-related services like ride sharing, delivery, maintenance and repair available? No.
Is car ownership still necessary? Some might argue yes.
Is car-sharing more convenient and more sustainable than car ownership? Perhaps.
Bikes are faster and cheaper ways to travel around town. Bike share in NYC is available through several companies and you can reserve your bicycle online. Bike rentals range from $10-$35/hour. Many bike shops also rent bikes outright.

If you're not familiar with the term "gut flora" it basically refers to the bacterial population in your gut, often referred to as "the good" or "proliferative" bacterium. It is a major contributor to healthy digestive system functioning. It plays several roles including breaking down food for energy, absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating waste products such as hydrogen sulphide, which can cause gas and bloating.
Are probiotic supplements useful? In theory they should be. Probiotics are beneficial to your health and help improve digestive functioning. But we are talking about an intra-abdominal microbiota, i.e., probiotics live within the walls of your abdomen. Is this a system that responds to stress? Do probiotics exert any stress-protective effects?
Given the large number of possible stressors (nutritional, metabolic, dietary and environmental) a special emphasis should be placed on probiotics to reduce their deleterious effects. As mentioned previously, stress is an important risk factor for chronic disease in general adults. A systematic review of published articles identified 43 studies investigating the role of gut flora in stress reactivity. Unfortunately, most of these studies involved healthy subjects or patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Stress is also associated with depression in these subjects, so if probiotics can reduce depressive symptoms they might help alleviate the burden of stress in difficult situations.

As parents, you may not know what you don't know about cochlear implants and hearing aids. It can seem overwhelming figuring out how much homework you need to do just to understand your child's audiological needs.
Thankfully, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale rates your child's level of comprehension, understanding, and ability to communicate with others after stroke.

HISTORICAL SOURCEBOOK OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CANADA: ISSUES OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE OF VANCOUVER
The following are some key terms used to identify the Catholic Church in Canada before 1968. These terms are listed alphabetically by subject and include references to a few key documents or people associated with these issues. There is also an index which lists terms under "Canada", "Ethnicity" and "Gender". You can search this sourcebook using any word in the title, subtitle, author name or text content of a document. We have attempted to provide a concise summary of each document in its entirety; however there may be some omnipresence of the terminology. Should you require more clarification about a document's content or language please contact us at archdioceseofvancouver (at)gmaild (dot) com (dot) ca and we will do our best to help clarify any ambiguities. The term "Ethnocultural" refers to individuals or groups who are culturally affiliated with the Catholic Church, whether of French Canadian origin or not. We use "Ethnocultural" to identify groups based on this affiliation but we acknowledge that it is a contested term in light of the diversity of groups within the Catholic community. The term "Ethno-religious" refers to individuals or groups who are culturally affiliated with the Catholic Church, whether of French Canadian origin or not. While both ethnolinguistic and ethno-religious groups were historically dominant in the Catholic community it appears that the term ethnocultural has been overemphasized in relation to this issue. Home Sports Injury and its effects on sports performance: Is it a worldwide phenomenon?
Injury and its effects on sports performance: Is it a worldwide phenomenon?
By Dhanraj Sharma -
Injuries affect athletes at different levels of competition. Amongst professional athletes, there is the problem of sports medicine. They are the ones responsible for getting injured players back into sporting action as soon as possible, while maintaining the integrity of their sporting careers. However, due to the increasing number of sports injuries, there is a growing concern in athletes, particularly amongst pro athletes, about injury prevention in order to enhance performance.
Recovery time from sport injuries can range from 3 months upwards, depending on many factors including the type of injury, whether it is a career ending injury, or a career limiting injury. It is often the case, though, that some athletes have a more negative impact of sport than others.
Injury-related career shortening factors: age, injury history, and performance in competitive sport
Performance in sport can have an important influence on career length and direction for athletes with special talents. However, it is not always related to career length and direction. Many pro athletes are also at increased risk of injury during peak sporting performance due to the specific demands of their job. For example, elite athletes tend to have more severe injury related career shortening factors than average athletes, even after retirement. Some common factors include injury history, and performance in competitive sport. A more general injury related shortening of sporting careers would involve injury history and performance in competitive sport, both of which have been shown to increase the risk of sport injury in pro athletes.
However, there are other factors associated with sport injury occurrence, such as age and injury history. Both pro and amateur athletes may experience sport-related injury mortality rates. Age-related differences in sport injury mortality rates have been reported between amateur and professional athletes, as well as between men and women. As expected, pro athlete mortality rates were higher among men than women. However, these results are inconsistent in the literature and may result from methodological differences.
Recovery Time from Sport Injury: is There a difference Between Athletes and Non-Athletes?
Athletes who play team sports are at increased risk for sport injury than athletes who play individual sports, because teams need to work together to compete. However, despite the increased risk of injury, athletes with special talents also experience significant injury mortality rates. It appears that athletes at greater injury mortality rates are those who have special talents or abilities that require advanced physical skills. Conversely, athletes with less special

Blog / The New Frontier in Cancer Immunology: Is there an opportunity to modify clinical outcomes with targeted immunomodulation?
Cancer Immunol Immunotherapy: a New Frontier in Cancer Therapy?
Most cancer patients who develop oligo/hyperproliferative states during their treatment are at increased risk of developing recurrent disease, especially as long as they continue to rely on chemotherapy alone. Does this mean that we should rely on adjuvant immune modulators in addition to chemotherapy to improve clinical outcome in these patients? I think not!
Immunological studies have focused on cancer immunity in two broad ways. First, we have studied immunologic mechanisms of chemosensitization using PET-based immunoassays to monitor antibody responses during cancer therapy. Second, we have studied the efficacy of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against cancer through cellular immunoreactivity using flow cytometry or ELISA. In a recent study from my lab, we examined the efficacy of siRNAs against prostate cancer immunity by comparing the antiproliferative response of preoperative high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy with that of non-preoperative low-risk patients receiving adjuvant leuprolide. Patients with prostate cancer were treated with M-VEC, a mitotane-based regimen using extended aortic replacement after myomectomy; in the context of this regimen, we suspected any potential immune response to chemotherapy would be mediated through the kidney, since the ureteral nodes are largely out of the cancer pathway for many prostate cancers. Using ELISPOT assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained prior to nephrectomy and before the initiation of chemotherapy, we detected antibodies directed against leuprolide, carboplatin, and mitotane. We also tested whether these patients exhibited an increase in the incidence of urinary tract infections during the initial period of cancer therapy using both culture and antigen testing. We found that urinary tract infections increased significantly among these patients during the initial period of chemotherapy, an effect apparently associated with immune depletion in the perioperative

Apple has filed an amended complaint against Qualcomm in U.S. court
The new complaint comes after Apple sued Qualcomm last year over licensing fees and other terms of its agreements with iPhone makers. Qualcomm countersued, saying it was wrongly targeted by Apple.
Apple has filed an amended complaint against Qualcomm in U.S. court seeking an order requiring the chipmaker to pay royalties for using Essential patents in chips made by third-party manufacturers. The company alleged that Qualcomm illegally charged for Essential patent licenses and that the company's royalty policies violated contract law.
Qualcomm countersued, saying the company was wrongfully targeted by Apple and had not violated any contractual obligations.
The two sides submitted the latest version of their respective positions this week. The case has yet to go to trial.
The amended complaint includes a "new" section, citing a 2018 order from the International Trade Commission (ITC) that found Apple had violated a patent license agreement between it and Qualcomm. Qualcomm appealed the ITC decision but lost in federal district court last month. It then appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. But last month, the appeals court reversed the lower court and said it would hear arguments next summer on whether Qualcomm should have to pay Apple royalties under a separate patent agreement. Qualcomm declined to comment beyond reiterating the legal reasoning behind its position. Apple declined to comment further, referring only to the previously filed complaint.

If there is any place in the world where it's safe to be a teenage girl, it's India. Is the mother-child relationship really more important than the child-parent relationship in your country?
 It's often a woman who plays the decisional role in the family-planning process: she decides whether her daughter will have children or not; whether they will be fathered by her son or not. A 2006 study published in Lancet showed that women are more than half of the decision makers in contraceptive choices for their daughters in 34 countries. In India it is estimated that as many as one out of two women have the final say on the family-planning decisions of their daughters!
 If women are the decisional role in the family-planning process in India, it is also estimated that as many as one out of three Indians is an active member of NGOs working in this field! That's a lot of women power to play with. Are NGOs as responsible in terms of population control as their sponsors are?
 While it seems to be an altruistic pursuit, it has its own agenda. When it comes to contraception, the women themselves don't matter at all.
 The Indian government's Contraceptive Education Material for Women (CEM) is a good example of a sponsored program designed specifically to influence women's reproductive health knowledge and behavior. The CEM material focuses on the role of women in childbearing and reproduction. It presents a woman-centric narrative emphasizing the importance of education, family planning, and choice of method during contraceptive deliberations among women. It is not a balanced presentation of facts. As we saw earlier, the male decision maker in the family-planning process is seldom questioned or challenged, but the female decision maker is the most scrutinized and the least respected. And the role of women is further diminished when the CEM materials are combined with the mother-child relationship. After the family-planning deliberation has been concluded, the CEM material states that both husband and wife should get involved in childrearing decisions: "Even though men and women are equally responsible for the upbringing of their children, it is often the women who provide emotional care and love to their children." Women are advised to talk to their husbands about their future plans and preferences for childbearing. Men, on the other hand, are encouraged to "consider" a family-planning approach for his wife if he wants her to be happy. In fact, the CEM materials are so feminine-centered that in addition to women as the decisional role in the family-planning process, they are also presented as the primary target group in family-planning campaigns.
 The mother-child relationship is thus portrayed in the family-planning arena as a "choice" between "coercion" and "free-choice," between "mother-directed" and "child-directed" methods of family-planning. It is argued that a coercive mother-child relationship is more conducive to child survival than a free-choice mother-child relationship. If coercion-and-negotiation strategies were implemented, mothers would be forced to make compromises in their own self-interest while children would be raised in a nurturing environment and survive as long as possible.
The use of coercion and negotiation techniques in family-planning campaigns is a "no-brainer"? Why not? In our democracy and multicultural society, the mother-child relationship should be valued and respected. If not in the family-planning process, then certainly outside of it.
 In 2007 the CEM materials were updated and the CEM model was redesigned to become more relevant to local cultures and conditions. This re-design was guided by a participatory process which included input from the National Family Health Survey, National Institutes of Health, and state government representatives. These are some of the changes to

Are your knees hurting you while working out at the gym?
Do you wish you had stronger legs for running, jumping, or performing other sports activities?
If yes, then you need to try leg development supplements. These supplements can easily and effectively increase leg power and stamina during sports training.
Are there supplements that will help you develop better legs for sport activity?
yes, if they are designed right!
Athletes' performance during sports training may be severely hindered due to weak leg muscles.
Most athletes will agree with me when I say that their knees hurt them during sports training as well as their legs? They complain of pain in knee joints as well as in the legs.
Luckily, there is a growing demand among athletes for better-functioning legs? I have heard from many athletes who use supplements to enhance leg function and stamina during sports training.
Although these supplements work great for athletes' performance during sports training, they are also very helpful to athletes' everyday lives. They increase athletes' stamina and agility during daily activities such as running around the block with children or playing ball games.
These supplements work great for athletes' stamina, agility, and athleticism during daily activities too!

As a prelude to the 7th Annual Meeting of the North American Colleges and Universities Chemical Society, the 2018 Distinguished Lecturer is scheduled for Thursday evening, September 20th. The lecture, entitled "Living Organic Compounds in Food: are they an emerging food safety risk?", will be delivered by Dr. Brian Houldcroft, Professor of Chemistry at Louisiana State University. in New Orleans.
 The lecture is free and open to the public..... científicos. inizià. <p>Dr. Houldcroft is a native of England who received his PhD from the University of Durham, England. He started teaching at LSU in 1987 as an instructor in chemistry, and is now a full professor. His research interests are in the area of food biochemistry. He has published many articles on this topic, and serves currently as the Editor of the Journal of Food Biochemistry.Dr. Houldcroft's lecture topic will center around the use of organoleptic data in the emerging area of food safety risk assessment. While some of our more common risk indicators are well-established and reliable, others have more stringent criteria associated with them than we may want to accept. Therefore, a food safety evaluation approach centered around the use of both organoleptic data and standard food-related risk indicators may serve us better than an approach based purely on the use of standard risk indicators alone. Dr. Houldcroft's lecture will focus on the use of the food-related organoleptic data in assessing potential food safety hazards, and will include case studies illustrating how organoleptic data analysis can lead to novel approaches to risk assessment.The lecture is part of the Annual Meeting of NACUC, which is free and open to the public <p>There will also be a reception for lecture attendees after the lecture; see below for details about the reception. For additional information about NACUC and its meetings, see www.nacuc.org<p>NACUC is a nonprofit organization sponsored by academic chemistry departments and colleges of northeastern universities. It is dedicated to improving the food safety of U.S. consumers, the food industry, and future generations. <p>Please direct any questions or concerns regarding the lecture to Dr.<p> <a href="mailto:lukem@lsu.edu" class="contact-author" title="contact author">Houldcroft, B.</a> <p>or <a href="mailto:mechand@lsu.edu" class="contact-authors" title="contact authors">Mechanad, A.</a> <p> How we found out our house was safe aftermath of Manchester bomb attack?
Rebecca Carlyon, Local Democracy ReporterThursday 25 May 2017 3:36 pm
A local man is set to face justice in court for aiding terrorists aftermath of the Manchester bombing.
A man has admitted being part of the terror cell plotting attacks targeting military bases and public events in the north east of England after the Manchester bombing in May last year.
Members of a terror cell, which included an Islamist preacher, are to face justice in court over the plan to carry out attacks.
Rayhanul Haq, from Widnes, is one of three men who were arrested at their homes in April this year. They have already admitted planning attacks targeting military bases and public events in the north of England, including the Tyneside military base in Newcastle.
Haq, 43, who is a carpet cleaner, told a police officer he was going to 'get the knife out' during an interview on March 8 but he did not use it. He denied preparing any sort of chemical attack during his arrest. Police arrested him after he returned from a trip to Syria in January.
Haq's son-in-law Abid Iqbal is another member of the cell who is facing prosecution today (May 25). Iqbal, 48, has been charged with assisting an individual preparing to carry out an act of terrorism while he was a guest at an address near Newcastle city centre.

Keywords: gluten-free diet; gluten-free diet nutritional assessment; gluten-free diet deficient in some nutrient; gluten-free diet sufficient in some nutrient; gluten-free diet deficient in some vitamins; gluten-free diet deficient in some amino acids; gluten-free diet adequate in some nutrients
Most gluten-free diets contain gluten or a significant amount of gluten. Some gluten-free diet contain gluten-free diet nutrient deficiencies or are deficient in some nutrient. Gluten-free diet can be nutritionally adequate when gluten-free diet nutrient status is normal. Gluten-free diet is usually adequate in some vitamin and amino acid nutrient as well as some nutrient in excess of recommended dietary allowances (RDA). Gluten-free diet may be deficient in some nutrient or food components. However, gluten-free diet is often enough in some nutrient or food component. Gluten-free diet may not be adequate in some nutrient and food components. Thus gluten-free diet may have some nutritional shortages. Is gluten-free diet adequate in some nutrient or food components?
The term gluten-free diet was coined in 1986 to describe diet that does not contain wheat, barley, rye, and oats. In 2002, some health organizations issued recommendations on gluten-free diet. Nowadays some nutritional experts have questioned the use of the term gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diet was originally proposed to describe wheat allergy and wheezing in asthmatics, but now it is proposed to describe nutritional adequacy of gluten-free diet. A gluten-free diet can be nutritionally adequate? Gluten-free diet can be nutritionally adequate when gluten-free diet nutrient status is normal.

Injury and poisoning mortality among young people--are there any common factors amenable to prevention? • No. Is there a relationship between the use of alcohol and carotid atherosclerosis in apparently healthy young people? • Yes, but this is an area that should be explored more closely by epidemiologists and cardiologists. • Is the use of alcoholic liqueurs such as vodka or gin associated with an increased risk of venous cancers in apparently healthy young people? • Yes, in this group too, some causal factors may exist. • Is it time for public awareness campaigns? • Yes, although they are expensive and targeted at young people who don't drink alcohol, they could do much damage to their image if they are aimed at parents. • Yes, targeting young people will not work if their parents aren't interested. • No, alcohol-related cancers in apparently healthy young people don't have the same epidemiological pattern as those in apparently healthy adults, and there is no evidence of a need for targeting young people. • Yes, perhaps there are young people for whom alcohol consumption in moderation does not pose a cancer risk, and targeting them with campaigns doesn't make sense.

Is it possible to run a 12 hour powered walk without sleep deprivation? Can we take a powered walk without sleep deprivation? Does sleep deprivation reduce athletic performance?

For an additional fee, a nurse or a nurse practitioner will evaluate your medical history and physical status for conditions related to preoperative anemia. If conditions are detected, a consultation is provided regarding surgical alternatives.
A consultation fee is billed at the time of the initial evaluation. If a nurse or a nurse practitioner confirms the existence of anemia, a consultation fee is charged at the time of the consultation. A consultation will be billed at the standard rate of $35 for the first 30 minutes of the initial evaluation. Thereafter, the fee will increase by the equivalent of 1.3 times the base charge for every 30 minutes afterward (except for the final bill, which includes all charges).
Are there any limitations to the use of nontriplicate specimens in the evaluation of preoperative anemia?

 Q: How to use 'is' and 'are' in same sentence? Is the following sentence grammatically correct?
 is it a sentence?
I used to play with my younger brother, who is now living abroad.
But I can also use  'is' and 'are' together:
 I used to play with my younger brother, whom is living abroad right now.?
Can both versions of the sentence work? 
Is one version more accurate than another version?


A: Yes, the sentences do have equal grammatical status.  Both are acceptable in standard American English.  For example:  

I used to play with my younger brother, whom I live close by.  
Is there a difference between "live close by" and "live nearby"?   Maybe they mean the same thing in both languages?   Maybe some other words are more appropriate in "close by" than "live nearby"?   

A: There can sometimes be a difference between being and having as far as grammatical phrasing goes.
"Having is" is not grammatically incorrect in this sense (no?), whereas "being is" is sometimes problematic or even wrong. 
Having a pet dog or a cat can be considered a matter of having (having is the past tense of have) as opposed to being a matter of having (being is the present participle of have).
Household pets, such as cats, that need a home will, over time, acquire owners' attitudes towards their caregiving. In other words, they become "owned" pets. Owning a pet dog or a cat is different from owning it in an animal shelter or a local veterinary clinic. Owning it in an animal shelter means you have legal custody of the animal at all times and make decisions about its care. In an animal hospital, however, you usually don't have those kinds of rights and can only provide medical care.
"Being" and "having" can be similar in this sense: either person can be your "pet" and have a say in how it's cared for. As a result, both "being" and "having" can be used in positive phrases and negative phrases. Here are two examples of each:
(1) It's good to be healthy. Having a sick pet is a painful experience for most people.
(2) You can't be a carpenter without having a tool box.
In these two examples, the first phrasing is a general idea of healthy versus unhealthy people/pets and their living situations. The second phrasing uses positive language to describe having healthy children who live in a healthy environment with healthy adults. 
You can have a pet or have a pet; it's a matter of having a pet.
 Q: Is there any way to perform partial backward pass in NN network? I am trying to perform partial backward in neural network, as follows:
# partial_backwards.cpp
template <typename T>
void partial_backwards() {
    int size = std::max(1, std::min(4, trainable_weight_.size()));
    weight_.resize(trainable_weight_.size(), 0);

    weight_[1] += 1;      // forward pass
    weight_[3] -= 1;     // backward pass
    weight_[3] -= 1;     // forward pass
}

The above code works fine if I replace forward pass with backward pass. However, it stops working after the backward pass, since the gradients are initialized zero.
It seems like the partial backward method works in a forward pass manner, but in a backward pass manner I get NaNs. 

A: We can try to change some things:
# partial_backwards.cpp
// partial_backwards.cpp
template <typename T>
void partial_backwards() {
    int size = std::max(1, std::min(4, trainable_weight_.size()));
    weight_.resize(trainable_weight_.size(), 0);

    weight_[1] += 1;                        // forward pass

Citation: Yang L (2013) A preoperative staging system based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale for predicting stroke patients' functional outcome: is there a cut-off point for prediction? Stroke 44(8):2095-2097.
Purpose: In addition to the hemoglobinopathies, thrombopillars and arterial calcification, acute ischemic and non-ischemic stroke patients may suffer from disabilities ranging from mild disabilities to severe disabilities. Functional outcome is affected by multiple factors in each patient, including stroke patients' ability to perform activities of daily living and ability to communicate. We hypothesized that there could be a "cut-off" point for stroke patients' functional outcome. Therefore, we designed a preoperative functional assessment instrument based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale to predict stroke patients' functional outcome. This paper presents the conceptual model, technical progression, and functional outcome of the instrument.
Methods: Patients' functional outcome was predicted via a computerized tomography-based preoperative functional assessment. Specifically, we determined the probability of stroke patients having progressive disabilities after stroke. Then, we selected an "optimistic" staging system for predicting stroke patients' functional outcome.
Results: After stroke, patients with a moderate disability performed tasks requiring low mental energy; patients with a severe disability performed tasks requiring high mental energy; and patients with a very severe disability performed tasks requiring no mental energy. However, for prediction of patients' functional outcome, we should consider the combined effect of stroke patients' disabilities, which are related to cognitive, physical, and/or psychological factors.
Conclusion: We developed a conceptual model of stroke patients' functional outcome. Based on the model, we designed a preoperative functional assessment instrument based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale to predict

Students with bachelor's degrees in engineering, science, math, or other fields of study may qualify for admission into one of four specialized master's programs: electrical engineering; computer science; meteorology; or marine engineering. There is no application fee for these programs. Applicants must submit an online application form that includes official transcripts from every college they have attended. They should include a statement of purpose discussing career interests and goals. In addition, applicants must submit GRE scores. We can perform a full audit of your current supply chain and recommend a number of ways you could improve it. This would include identifying any areas where suppliers are outsourcing activities which are usually performed in house (eg, transportation). You might also be surprised to learn how much your supplier's costs are rising.
We can also work alongside you to identify cost savings by improving internal logistics and inventory management. We would always aim to achieve cost savings of at least 10% without compromising service levels, but these savings are likely to be more significant if we can reduce your procurement expenditure further.
Increasingly, procurement managers are looking to reduce their procurement costs while increasing service level and satisfaction levels with suppliers. They recognise that often, they are spending too much money on external suppliers and too little of this money is available for investing in inhouse capacity building.
Through our extensive industry knowledge, experience working within the logistics sector and our use of industry benchmarking data, we can help your organisation make better cost savings. It is well-documented that chronic low back pain (CLBP) adversely affects patients' healthcare resources and long-term health care benefits. However, a growing literature suggests that chronic low back pain (CLBP) is an occupational disease, one with potentially compensable long-term disability benefits. This paper explores the concept of compensable occupational disease in light of the history of the development of CLBP in the United States. We are proud to announce that we are the recipient of an Outstanding Business Achievement Award from the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce.

Knee reconstruction is a potential alternative to partial knee disarticion, knee revision surgery and total knee arthroplasty. Due to the large number of possible knee revision surgical options available for knee revision surgery, knee reconstruction is a potential alternative to partial knee disarticion and knee revision arthroplasty. There are many factors that play an important role in the selection of the knee revision surgery: the patient's clinical presentation and functional needs, the surgeon's training and experience, the surgeon's interest and expertise in knee revision arthroplasty. A knee revision surgery can be performed in many ways by different types of knee revision arthroplasty: primary knee revision arthroplasty (primary knee arthroplasty) and secondary knee revision arthroplasty. Primary knee revision arthroplasty has been demonstrated as a safe and reliable way of knee revision surgery with good knee functional results. It is often a difficult knee revision surgery because it is a major knee revision surgery that is performed without the use of a humeral component. The humeral components in knee revision arthroplasty are frequently used in knee revision surgery. However, they can be expensive and can significantly increase knee revision surgery costs. Secondary knee revision arthroplasty has some advantages over primary knee revision arthroplasty in knee revision surgery: it may offer more functional knee revision surgery and it can be performed without a humeral component. Secondary knee revision arthroplasty is an alternative to partial knee disartision and knee revision arthroplasty and the cost of knee revision arthroplasty is lower than primary knee revision arthroplasty. Due to the high cost of knee revision arthroplasty and its complexity, secondary knee revision arthroplasty is a potential option in knee revision surgery for patients who cannot afford knee revision arthroplasty and/or do not want to undergo a knee revision arthroplasty due to their aesthetic and functional needs. A knee revision surgery can also benefit knee revision arthroplasty surgery outcomes and cost effects by improving knee joint kinematics, reducing mechanical dysfunction, and lowering knee revision arthroplasty surgery hospitalization and revision surgery complication rates. A knee revision arthroplasty can improve functional outcome of the knee and reduce knee revision surgery revision arthroplasty hospitalization and revision surgery complication rates. A knee revision arthroplasty surgery has many potential benefits for knee revision surgery outcomes and cost effects compared to knee revision arthroplasty without a humeral component. In addition, a knee revision arthroplasty surgery also has advantages over primary

July 27, 2016 at 4:00 PM
"We knew going into training camp that we wanted to change our focus," said St. Louis offensive coordinator Kenny "Willy" Williams Jr., referring to his new-look offense. "And I think it has been evident as you've watched the film. We have had a better running game in this preseason than we did last year in training camp." The United States is a small island nation on a big ocean, surrounded by some of the world's most powerful navies. The United States Navy has an aggressive, persistent air warfare strategy that focuses on interdiction of merchant ships traveling between Asia and Latin America.
The United States has an advantage in this air warfare battle because of its carrier aviation dominance. Carriers make up approximately 37 percent of all U.S. aircraft carriers by flight operating hours during a typical war week. The majority of these hours flown are by Carrier Air Wings. The AW wing's tactical mission is simple: to protect and defend the ship under attack from hostile air threats such as aircraft and missiles. To accomplish this mission, the AW wing executes two primary tasks; to defend the ship against air attack and to provide support for air operations. The AW wing conducts both air defense and air support missions under the direction of the carrier air wing captain. During an air operation, the AW wing performs the following tasks:
• Provide fighter defense for the strike group.
• Conduct fighter and AW ground support missions.
• Prepare for offensive strikes using the strike group's fighters and AWs.
• Collect information about enemy forces and their intentions using the strike group's radar systems.
• Monitor incoming enemy fighter formations using the strike group's command-and-control (C2) systems.
• Provide targeting information for incoming fighter formations.
• Use friendly fighter aircraft to deny enemy aircraft access to the strike group's strike area.
• Locate enemy aircraft and provide fighter air-to-air refueling for strike groups aircraft.
• Contain and destroy enemy aircraft while simultaneously supporting carrier surface combatants.
• Support carrier surface combatants in the engagement of enemy surface targets.
In order to perform these tasks effectively, the USN air wing requires specific training in air defense and air support operations. In particular, a carrier air wing must be trained in carrier air defense so it can adequately defend its strike group during air operations. For instance, USN fighter aircraft must be capable of providing air-to-air defense during day and night in all weather conditions, using all air defense modes available, and able to execute air-to-surface missions during air operations. In addition to performing defensive duties, AW air wings participate in offensive strikes, providing air support for the strike group and ground forces.
Most carrier air wings are composed of about 50 C-model Avenger or E-model F-14 Tomcat fighters, a mix of new and obsolete fighters. These aircraft are configured for both air defense and air support missions. The aircraft also includes other equipment, including the SH-2F Seawolf helicopter. These aircraft perform carrier air defense in the low altitude/low visibility environment, defending against anti-ship missiles and naval aircraft. During this time, the fighter aircraft will not be able to provide air-to-air support for the strike group or support carrier air forces. Additionally, the SH-2F is not equipped to perform the air-ground support mission performed by the strike group. Dialysis patient with diabetes mellitus treated in India: a cause for concern?

Do you remember the sights and sounds of Christmas when you were a child? Have you lost touch with your inner child? Christmas is an especially good time to rekindle those childhood memories! We will provide an activity to remind everyone of their childhood, and then open the meeting so everyone can share stories and memories of their childhood. We hope these stories will bring smiles and laughs during one of the happiest times of the year! In a world without laws protecting individual privacy, many employers are likely to use information gleaned from job applicants as a proxy for employee retention. But what if the job applicant's work history includes incidents of sexual harassment? Should this be considered when determining whether or not to hire an applicant? And if so, does the number of incidents of sexual harassment count as a proxy for employee retention? Maybe. What can be said about the 90 minutes of unbridled joy and pure unadulterated hysteria that were unfurled by The Kooks Saturday night at the Tannery in Derby? I don't think I could add much to my friend, JC's words here; we were all swept away by The Kooks and it was nothing less than magical.
Although we are newbies to their music, we have seen many other bands perform at the Tannery. In fact, one of our favorite memories came when seeing the likes of The Boomtown Rats performing at the Tannery back in 2007. What was remarkable about their performance then, was just how many young people were there that had obviously never heard of them before, but were now totally immersed in their music and were singing along with every word.
Well, tonight, The Kooks did something similar. There weren't many people there tonight who hadn't heard of them previously; they were all hanging onto every note and lyric

BOSTON (CBS) — A woman from Southeast Massachusetts is facing a new charge in connection with the slaying of her estranged husband, and she now faces a different murder charge than the one she was originally charged with.
 prosecutors announced Monday afternoon.
 Amanda Bostic, 35, of Dartmouth appeared in district court Monday afternoon on an alleged assault charge in connection with her estranged husband's killing earlier this year. However, she also faces a second murder charge stemming from her husband's stabbing death last October. prosecutor David G. has since allegedly fled the state, and he is listed as "no longer to be found" by the Suffolk County sheriff's department. Increased mortality among older patients receiving treatment for chronic disease in some U.S. states may reflect differences in health care delivery and/or patient survival among those states.1 In addition to socioeconomic differences, patient characteristics may contribute to disparities in mortality among older patients who develop acute pneumonia or pulmonary embolism while in a U.S. hospital? We analyzed data from Medicare Part A beneficiaries aged 80 or older for 2002-2007 to determine whether there were any significant differences in mortality rates among Medicare beneficiaries who developed pneumonia or pulmonary embolism while in a U.S. hospital compared to other Medicare beneficiaries? We compared Medicare beneficiaries age 80 or older who developed pneumonia or pulmonary embolism while in a U.S. hospital in 2002-2007 versus Medicare beneficiaries age 80 or older who did not develop pneumonia or pulmonary embolism during their life expectancy? The Medicare beneficiaries who developed pneumonia or pulmonary embolism while in a U.S. hospital between 2002-2007 had significantly higher mortality rates than Medicare beneficiaries who did not develop pneumonia or pulmonary embolism during their life expectancy? Additionally, Medicare beneficiaries who developed pneumonia or pulmonary embolism while in a U.S. hospital in 2002-2007 had significantly lower mortality rates than Medicare beneficiaries who developed pneumonia or pulmonary embolism while in a U.S. hospital in 2002-2007? We further examined Medicare beneficiaries age 80 or older who developed pneumonia or pulmonary embolism while in a U.S. hospital between 2002-2007 and died in a U.S. hospital?

by Alyssa | Mar 31, 2022 | Entrepreneurs | 0 comments
When it comes to entrepreneurship, there are plenty of stories of success and failures. In order to become successful as an entrepreneur, it's important to have the right mindset and approach.
Here are some tips to becoming a successful entrepreneur:
Take risks: Entrepreneurs who take risks often succeed. Whether it's by starting a new business or taking on a new project, it's important to always have an idea of what's ahead.
Think big: If you want to become an entrepreneur, think big. It takes courage to start a business of your own and take on all the risks associated with it. But if you have the ambition to succeed, anything is possible.
Be willing to learn: Entrepreneurship requires a lot of learning. There will be many challenges along the way, but if you're willing to learn from them, you'll be on your way to becoming a successful entrepreneur.
Set goals: Setting goals is a key step towards becoming an entrepreneur. Not only will it help you reach your goals, but it will also motivate you to keep going.
Have a positive attitude: Having a positive attitude is one of the most important factors in becoming an entrepreneur. No matter what obstacles you face along the way, you need to have a positive outlook.
Take action: Once you have the mindset of an entrepreneur, take action. Start small and build up your confidence. Never give up!
Look at the bigger picture: One of the biggest lessons I've learned from being an entrepreneur is to look at the bigger picture. Even if your initial goal isn't to become a millionaire overnight, it's important to set yourself realistic goals so that you can stay motivated.
Be persistent: persistence is one of the most important traits of an entrepreneur. Don't give up when times get tough. Keep working even when you don't see results immediately. You can always change your mind, but the more persistence you show, the sooner you'll succeed.
Remember, your journey will never end — just keep learning from the mistakes of others, improve your craft, and be confident in your ability to succeed. Newcastle University > Postgraduate > Find a PhD topic > Health psychology: a neglected research area?<
Health psychology: a neglected research area?<
Health psychologists contribute significantly to health service delivery and health policy in the United Kingdom. However, health psychological knowledge and skills appear to be underutilised in practice. Is this a consequence of poor awareness of health psychology among practitioners, or lack of appropriate training of existing practitioners? Or are there other barriers to its effective use in healthcare?<
These were some of the questions raised by the research team in this study. They took a qualitative approach to identify gaps in the evidence base relating to health psychology. The team used content analysis of relevant publications; interviews with health psychologists; focus groups with health care workers; and case studies from practitioners' experience. Their findings suggest a number of ways to increase health psychological literacy among practitioners in the short term, and future research directions. <

# Introduction

## # Preface

This is my first introduction to the work of the Benedictine Sisters of Saint Joseph Monastery on Pine Mountain. I'm grateful for their hospitality and generosity in accommodating my visit. My thanks also go to Dr. Susan Foster, Director of the Venerable John Harding Archives, for her insights into how the women of Saint Joseph responded to the early ministry of St. Faustina Kowalska, especially as she wrote about her experiences during the pastoral year that followed her ordination to the diaconate in 1934. She was also kind enough to answer questions about the early years of the congregation of Saint Joseph, when Fr. Faustina, as she wrote, "had a humble but courageous attitude toward her vocation, with an outstretched hand toward the whole Church."

The first version of this introductory chapter appeared on page one of the September/October issue of _The Leaf_, the magazine of the Saint Joseph Community. For permission to reproduce the text below please contact the monastic house of formation. Thanks also to Deidre Homer-Spradlin for sharing information from her time at the monastery, and for help with the translation from the original German.

I've always been a mystic—no matter what I've tried to study, no matter what I've been involved in, no matter where I've lived, and nowhere has it been more clear than it is here. It all boils down to a single word: _means_. There are always those who want me to stay in the material world: "Do you want to get rich quick?" But the way forward in these days can be found only through the means of the Holy Spirit.

This is not just a spiritual principle; it's a practical one too. To be effective as a mystical experience, one must have a personal encounter with the mystery of God and be willing to let it change your life in every area of it. You must be open to the divine and willing to let its grace transform your life. You can't just sit around waiting to have some grand mystical experience. You must be willing to do your part by working for others and living with integrity. This is a call to live a life of prayer and witness.

# St. Faustina's Consecrated Life and Service to the Poor Souls in Purgatory

It's a big surprise to learn that St. Faustina Kowalska, consecrated in the Roman Catholic Church in 1930, spent the next twenty-three years of her life in service to the poor souls in purgatory! Perhaps some readers will think the following list of saintly works of charity does not add up to more than two hundred. It does: twenty-three years in service to the poor souls in purgatory! Perhaps another reader will say that St. Faustina spent less than three years in service to the poor souls in purgatory (and probably not even four)? Still, some will think St. Faustina spent sixteen years in service to the poor souls in purgatory. That's true too: twelve in a convent on a mountaintop

"Clever" - The New Yorker, January 22, 1928
"Another way to understand and appreciate the music of Jelly Roll Morton is to hear him play it. At 9:30 last night, his New Orleans Jazz Band gave one of those evening's most memorable and absorbing concerts at Town Hall, where, under the direction of the bandleader himself, they showed that they still know how to keep it up."
"Would a man go nuts if he saw Jelly Roll Morton play?"
"I'd certainly do anything he told me to do. He knows exactly what I like in music; it's just that I don't know what I like yet." BUY PRODUCTS

In the fall semester of my junior year, I was a resident assistant in my dorm room. I worked with the residents and the RA's, and it felt like such a big family when we all got along so well. That summer, I took a seminar in New Urbanism, and that inspired me to start the blog. We will be examining the relationship between living space and healthcare benefits in New York City. My goal is to examine the potential effects of living in an urban environment on the health of New Yorkers, while also analyzing the effect of living near major medical centers. We'll see how health care benefit plans affect this health care landscape, as well as the impact of apartment rents and mortality rates have on the health care system overall.

But if your reds are too loud and bright, you're sure to be red hot! You might end up in a red-hot mess, if not red hot yourself.
In addition to all of its great health properties, red is a good omen for success in love and business. And, depending on whom you ask, red is either a lucky or unlucky color.
Whether you like red or not, it can never hurt to be prepared for the red carpet.
Wear some red: When going out for the evening, wear a little red lipstick, a bit of red makeup on your lips, a few splashes of red in your hair, or even a little red in your clothes.

The Shropshire Hills have many fine walking routes, and with some preparation, they can be enjoyed by walkers of all abilities. A number of local paths lead off from the main A49 and B4300 roads, making walking more accessible than on other routes. Most of our walking routes offer opportunities to enjoy the countryside close up, using quiet lanes and tracks rather than busy footpaths. Walking in Shropshire is very much part of the local way of life - it's a way of life we should be proud of!
The Shropshire Hills were designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1984, and are among the most beautiful parts of the English uplands. The hills themselves are a diverse group, containing some fine examples of ancient monument sites and natural features, and offering spectacular views over the surrounding countryside and townscapes. There are some great places to stay and eat out, and there are also a wide range of shops and amenities to cater for visitors' needs.
Many walking routes start from A49 and B4300 junctions just outside Shrewsbury, taking in some superb countryside and famous places,

 If one has been identified as deficient in any of the nutrients in the Dietary Reference Intake level, then one can add an extra daily vitamin or mineral supplement to get the additional vitamin/mineral from the food source. Vitamin D supplements are also added to increase the levels of vitamin D in the diet for those with low levels of vitamin D intake from the food sources alone. For those with higher than normal intakes of vitamin D, it is advised to take a multivitamin and mineral supplement daily.
The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) is a recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamins, minerals and other dietary elements based on a set of assumptions about population requirements for nutritional support. The RDA levels were based on a two-year study conducted by the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine which used a standardized diet formulated with 80% of the total diet energy as carbohydrate, 15% as protein and 5% as lipids. These recommendations have been updated and reaffirmed in 2005 by the National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Agriculture.
For purposes of determining daily nutrient adequacy, an estimated population requirement of vitamins, minerals and other dietary elements was calculated using the following formula: N vitamins = VEGF * PEER [16]. where, N vitamins refers to the RDA for vitamin A, beta-catenin ligand peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; VEGF represents vitamin G intraepithelial growth factor; PEER stands for pharmaceutically exploited endothelial growth factors and vitamin A, retinol and its conjugates as reference concentrations of vitamin A.
Vitamin A: retinol, vitamin A, retinaldehyde, metabolites and precursor species such as carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids.
Vitamin G: carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin A, retinol and its conjugates are metabolised to carbohydrates via the uridine-phosphate pathway. Retinoids are major metabolic intermediates in this pathway.
Vitamin D: the main carbohydrate metabolite of vitamin D. Vitamin D, the major carbohydrate metabolite of vitamin D, is involved in gluconeogenesis in response to fasting conditions and in lipid synthesis during feeding. It can also be formed de novo from both carbohydrates and lipids. It acts as an aggravating factor in the development of arterial calcification in patients with cardioembolic stroke. Its deficiency has an aggravating effect on atherosclerosis in patients with coronary disease, while the use of vitamin D therapy reduced the risk of vitamin D insufficiency in apparently healthy subjects. Vitamin D supplementation is an effective adjuvant in septic cholecystitis. Vitamin D supplementation seems to reduce the risk of vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients. A few years back I came across some excellent blog posts by a man named Chris Dixon that talked a lot about how and why to use A/

In this article I want to share with you a new experience that has recently taken place at Palau Güell: the opening of Park Güell as a public park in Barcelona.
The visit to Park Güell includes an audio guide and a free tour with a professional guide. There are several options available for your personalized itinerary. You can also join a family-oriented tour (it was our first choice).
For those who are not interested in the audioguide option, there is no need to worry. We still recommend you join a family-oriented tour with a guide. Our experience in this matter confirms what is written in the guidebook: a guided tour is always more enjoyable, fun and interactive. Children especially love it! And even adults will learn something new about Barcelona and its culture.
For example, the audioguide option allows you to follow a predefined route (you must fill out an online form beforehand) but, if you want, you can change direction during your visit and explore other parts of the park too.
On the other hand, choosing the family-oriented tour option allows you to benefit from a customized itinerary. We decided to book a walking tour for two reasons: we needed help translating some Spanish into English and, most importantly, we wanted the tour to be educational.
You can read in advance what we learned while visiting Park Güell. Then, depending on which option you choose, the audio guide or the family-oriented tour will give you more insight on certain subjects. For instance, during the audio tour you will discover some useful information about Park Güell's history and how the site came to be built.
Although Park Güell isn't a huge site to cover in just one afternoon, the audioguide will give you a full overview of the park and its different areas, plus you'll also learn fun facts like these.
Our experience in Barcelona and in Park Güell tells us: the best time of year to visit Park Güell is springtime. There is usually less rain here and the park is fresher too, as it hasn't been watered for months due to the long dry winter season. In addition

Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 did successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in improved obstetric practice? In this report we present the results of an international study on the use of carotid endarterectomy as a preventive measure for cardiovascular risk in the general population. It is concluded that, based on the results of this study, it may be time to reconsider carotid artery endarterectomy in the context of primary prevention.
 As it stands today the carotid endarterectomy rate in the Netherlands is quite low (1.4%): compared to the European average of about 5.6%. Is it therefore an efficient and cost-effective way of reducing cardiovascular mortality? Based on the results of this Dutch population-based study the answer seems to be no: there are no indications that carotid endarterectomy offers a cost-benefit ratio larger than one. a reduction in long-term health care benefits. Does the use of carotid endarterectomy make sense for the general population? this study shows no clear indication of cost-effectiveness. based on the results of this Dutch population-based study the conclusion is: maybe it should be reconsidered?

What a beautiful, glorious spring afternoon it was when I went over to Boundary Park yesterday to take some photos!
I'm still smiling because of the way this one turned out.
I think he looks very handsome in his red bandana hat.
There were a number of folks enjoying lunch, relaxing with friends and family, and enjoying their time at Boundary Park.
I took the time yesterday to do a little housecleaning.
I went from one end of my house to the other cleaning up clutter and dirt.
I love taking care of things.
I really like making lists... it is fun to cross things off.
Do y'all ever get a list of things you want to do around the house before something goes wrong? Or maybe you want to do those things anyway just to see if they are possible? Or do ya'll always start doing something?
I usually try to tackle as much as I can right away. If things fall through, I just move onto the next thing and keep doing my list. Sometimes it works out ok. Other times, not so much.
Today I found myself in the kitchen making coffee for several people, one after another, with a new group each time. I am a bit of a klutzerei [kluzar eh] (ahem) and it is frustrating for me not to know how long everything takes to make. So I tried the new group first. Then I took a break to do a load of laundry. Finally I came back and saw them all standing around drinking coffee.
Ask yourself these questions next time you find yourself dealing with multiple tasks at once.
1) Does someone else's input affect your work/life balance? Yes, but it shouldn't.
2) Can more than one task be accomplished at a time? Nope.
3) Are the tasks on your list different from what others are working on? That depends on the task itself.
In the end, sometimes you gotta roll with the punches and do what needs to be done. You're on vacation; what does one do? A. Aromatic hydrocarbons are obtained by various reactions involving the metabolism of aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole, peranox, and para-acetylafaminoisobutyl (PAFIB). These compounds are known to bind to uterine and ovarian membranes in non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor treated patients. These aromatic hydrocarbons are also metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A1 (CYP3A1) enzyme which is increased in uterine and ovarian tissues of postmenopausal women receiving letrozole or peranox for treatment of early breast cancer. The clinical significance of these aromatases has not been fully elucidated.

A 24-hour pharyngeal, oesophageal and stomach acidity assessment may predict the presence of non-ulcer dyspepsia, an unexplained symptomatic response to prokinetic agents in gastroenterological care. It can also predict the presence of small bowel atresia, if present. Thus, in addition to ultrasonographic evaluation of the stomach volume and composition, it provides information on the presence of small bowel atresia, which often go undetected by standard ultrasonography. It has been a busy time at the clinic! We've had some exciting additions to our staff; Dr. Mary Patricia Pecora, DMD, MS and her husband Dr. Jeffrey Pecora, DMD, MS joined us on July 25th as a full-time team member.

Wearable technology, or "wearables" for short, are becoming increasingly popular in the workplace and the way we live life today. They're the future of work and health care for the 21st century, and they'll have an impact on everything from sports medicine and public safety to health maintenance and quality of life at every stage of life. And wearable technology has already made its mark in workplaces around the world.
A growing number of companies are developing applications for wearable devices like Fitbits and Honeywell's iPulse that enable workers to stay healthy, alert and engaged both inside and outside of the office. Here are just a few examples of how wearable technology is changing the way we live and work today.
Bringing work to the workers is one of the key elements of productivity in today's global economy. Companies around the world, including big pharmaceutical firms and health care providers, recognize this and are developing mobile apps and wearable devices that help employees stay connected in the field while working efficiently.
Laparoscopic myomectomy, a minimally invasive option for myomas smaller than three centimeters, is a procedure performed every year in 80 percent of all myomatous cases in 30 countries around the world. In the United States alone, about 700 myomas are removed per week, according to statistics from the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Because they are not always diagnosed by doctors until after they have grown large enough to affect the motor system of the brain, they are sometimes difficult to treat. But the use of wireless technology to locate and stimulate the release of

If it's time to do some good for your family dental practice in the area of caring and prevention, give us a call and we will be happy to schedule a free preventive exam and consultation for your baby.
 At the beginning of your consultation, your child will visit our office for a full-mouth x-ray so that we can get a more accurate assessment of the amount of orthodontic work needed. Your child will then meet with Dr. Jensen one on one to discuss your child's needs and goals. Following the assessment and planning, we will work together to determine your child's treatment plan. and your child's financial obligations. Once your treatment has started, your child will also meet with Dr.:Jenson for another full-mouth x-ray so he/she can have his/her first impression of her/his new smile! I have been a patient of Dr. Snyder since 2013. He is truly a caring and compassionate doctor. My husband and I were married during this period and Dr. Snyder took extra care to ensure all the arrangements for our wedding day were executed flawlessly.

He is always open to new ideas and suggestions to improve service. I can wholeheartedly recommend him and his office staff. How long does it take to heal after a cold sore breakout?
I have a lot of the classic symptoms: tough skin, lesions, etc., but my cold sores breakouts are always so painful and don't heal up fast enough. I'm thinking it could be the virus itself - if there was a fast acting antiviral, I wouldn't need to wait two weeks before the lesions clear up.
Maybe it's just me, though; if anyone else agrees, let me know how long it takes for their cold sore breakouts to heal!
My cough and cold symptoms lasted 15 days and now they are not as bad as when I had a regular flu. I am still coughing and it hurts sometimes, but I can at least cough into a tissue and that's not a bad thing, right? I've heard that the common cold can run its course in about seven days, so hopefully mine will be gone by tomorrow afternoon? Hopefully!
Cold and flu breakouts are usually short lived, but they are not always. If you are concerned, seek professional advice from a medical provider. I'm sure they would be able to provide the best possible diagnosis and treatment.

Fuel prices have risen more than three-fold in four years, but has a special exemption on diesel prices been proposed to cushion the economic impact of increased fuel costs?
 The National Association of Petroleum Dealers has proposed a special exemption in the price of diesel. This is an extension of the previous exemptions in the price of petrol and in the taxes applicable to the fuel industry.

Economic and political factors have played a part in this increase, says Mr. Tomaszewski, adding however that these do not fully explain the increase of fuel prices.
 The increase in the price of diesel in December last year was the largest rise in the price of diesel since its introduction into Poland two decades ago. We at the APC have an exciting new opportunity available for the right candidate with a passion for quality assurance and continuous improvement in both radiotherapy and oncology care! As a Radiation Oncology Quality Assurance Specialist (ROQAS), you will work with patients and staff alike to improve quality of care, reduce variation in cancer treatment, and meet regulatory requirements for safe care delivery. You will assess radiation therapy outcomes using evidence-based methods to provide feedback to clinicians about improving patient outcome and minimizing risk of side effects. Additionally, as a result of ROQAS activity, the department may save thousands of dollars in preventable errors by reducing adverse events.

A young man's desire for a job that pays well and enables him to save money for college can be thwarted by the thought of long commutes, bad parking, and an uncomfortable ride. But if he wants to make his dream job happen, he'll need to be willing to travel far from home for it.

I know it sounds like a strange question, but I was wondering if I might have some advice on how to become an effective sales representative. My company is in the automotive industry, and one of our big concerns for 2019 is training up and maintaining the next generation of service advisors. I was just reading an article in Motor Trend about the importance of sales education in general and how important it is to be a good communicator in sales. I've been working in the automotive field for about five or six years now, and my previous employer didn't offer any sales training beyond the basics of customer service. Are there any online resources you recommend for sales representatives looking to better their communication skills? Any books, videos, or blog posts you'd suggest checking out? I think it would be very helpful for me personally, as well as those in my department that are trying to teach upcoming service technicians how to talk to customers the way they want them to communicate. I have a very strong background in mechanical and computer technology, and am interested in pursuing automotive sales as a possible career path. Thank you! Wound cultures obtained during the surgery of sebaceous cell carcinoma of the eyelid are characterized by a distinctive microenvironment favoring survival of the cells. Among these features, presence of vascular endothelium associated immunities in the culture supernatant should be considered predictor of worse prognosis in patients undergoing radical partial neck dissection (RPND). We evaluated the ability of C3a receptor to predict worse prognosis in patients undergoing RPND for sebaceous cell carcinomas of the eyelid. We also investigated whether the level of CSF3a is related to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 immunological staining in the eyelid nodes. CSF3a receptor was expressed in 50% of the eyelid nodes compared to 27% of the node in the subcutaneous eyelid. A significant decrease in the level of CSF3a immunostainings in the eyelid nodes obtained during RPND, strongly suggests a correlation between the number of CSF3a receptors per

 user error in echocardiography assessment of left ventricular function in dear patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation? In a small, spontaneously gathered crowd, with the added draw of some 40+ people interested in the subject, a very interesting talk was given last week. It began with a talk about the process of research and development, looking at some of the ways we know what we know about the effects of chemicals on humans during pregnancy. There is a need to be cautious about the use of risk assessment, as there are often assumptions made based upon what is known about how chemicals work together and what they do individually. It was explained that many people assumed the risk assessments would predict more harmful effects than they do for many chemicals because they assume chemicals work together (inter-radiation). This is based on what has been done in the past and is based on simplistic analysis.
 The use of animal models is also assumed to be more accurate than studies using human cells. It was explained why this is an assumption and an example of over-simplification and the potential for bias in modeling the effects of chemicals on human reproduction.
The presentation provided a detailed look into the use of animal models for assessing the effects of chemicals on the developing fetus. Many of the assumptions were based on simplistic analyses of animal data and were inaccurate. Animals were assumed to act as surrogates for humans due to their similarities in the way their reproduction systems operate and what is known about these systems in the first trimester. Many of the assumptions were also based upon what one might assume, without fully examining the evidence. The 53rd Annual Meeting of the American College of Cardiovascular Medicine will be held September 8th through the 12th, 2007, in Chicago, Illinois. The theme of this meeting will be "Midwives and Women's Health: a new role for the nurse?" This meeting is expected to attract more than 800 participants and feature more than 160 scientific abstracts.
Nurse Midwives: a new role for the nurse in women's health?
Nursing in Women's Health: Is it just a job? We use all kinds of methods to investigate and understand the sources of air pollution, including measurements and analyses at our laboratory or our field sites, and modelling techniques.
A major component of the work is to investigate whether the quality of air in cities around the world is affected by sources of air pollution other than those emitted from automobiles. Other factors can affect air quality also, for instance, population growth, industrial development, or urban sprawl. "Can my children have a normal life with depression and anxiety disorders?" asked one of our parents in a letter to The Guardian newspaper. "I worry so much for them, they get sick easily", she added. "Maybe it's time to think about psychosis treatment". The most common and frequently prescribed antibiotics in the United States are fluoroquinolones, or fluoroquinolynes. In addition to the fluoroquinolines, there are three quilmes, called imipenem/cilastatin, cefepime, and cefoxitin; all three of these are fluoroquinolanes.
All antibacterial medications (or any medication for that matter) can cause side effects in some way; even the fluoroquinolones! However, in general, when a patient starts a course of fluoroquinolone therapy, they should experience few side effects. However, if the patient takes too much fluoroquinolone, they may develop severe systemic side effects, sometimes fatal. Patients need to be monitorized closely to make sure they don't develop side effects. Fluoroquinolones are a contraindicated class of drugs in renal cell carcinoma, as they are associated with serious kidney side effects. In fact, fluoroquinolones are among the drugs most often removed from prescribing due to side effects.
Thrombomicroembolic syndrome: the clinically relevant plasma thickness of the peripheral pulmonary arteries.
Due to possible thrombopressive effects of fluoroquinolones, some experts are recommending against their use in acute pulmonary embolism. While this is not a universal recommendation, it is an option to consider in addition to standard

Ionis Pharmaceuticals will be exhibiting at the 13th Annual National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Surgeon's meeting September 26-28, 2005, Austin, TX, USA. The Company will also participate as a sponsor in the meeting's scientific sessions.
Ionis Pharmaceuticals will be exhibiting its portfolio of products and technologies, both drugs and drug delivery systems, at this year's Innovative Medicines Outlook and Technology Meeting September 26-28, 2005, Austin, Texas, U.S.A., where Ionis scientists and business development professionals will be available to discuss innovative therapeutic product candidates with potential marketing partners.
Nutrition and digestive health are central focus areas for Ionis Pharmaceuticals' research and development activities. The company is developing drugs targeted toward specific nutritional and physiological needs, including products designed to aid in weight loss, alleviate irritable bowel symptoms and restore natural gut flora balance. Additionally, these products are designed to improve nutrient uptake by the gastrointestinal tract and mitigate colon cancer risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Ionis Pharmaceuticals' drug development efforts are centered around its proprietary drug delivery systems, which are designed to deliver drugs to the gastric and small intestine, to stimulate healing of gastric anastomoses and increase colon cancer cellular uptake. These novel drug delivery systems utilize proprietary chemistries designed to overcome key limitations associated with current pharmacologic approaches for colon cancer therapy.
In addition, Ionis Pharmaceuticals' clinical stage products are in late phase development. They include Ionis-APOLLO (apoceptin), a potential adjuvant in septoplasty; Ionis-CROMIS (crustopentin), a potential adjuvant in primary knee arthroplasty; and Ionis-PELVAD (pelvic adrenal extracts) a potential adjuvant in postmenopausal women with early stage prostate cancer. Additionally, Ionis has received FDA approval of Ionis-TAK-3910, a combination therapy for allergic contact dermatitis from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The therapy consists of an intramuscular injection of saline and metapressin, administered every four hours for 48 hours. This combination therapy was shown to be more effective than either of the two components alone. ← A tribute to the late Patrice Eyler of Eyler & Co.

Papadopoulos K. et al. Enterostomy for small bowel atresia: does it improve colon and rectal surgical outcome? Will it also improve quality of life for the patients?<br> <br>The use of enterostomy after small bowel atresia has been advocated as a potential solution to improve colon and rectal surgical outcome. <br> <br>This case report will discuss the benefits and risks of enterostomy as a bridge between gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine system and colorectal circulation. <br> <br>In children with gastrointestinal atresia, the colon and rectal surgery are performed in a very difficult and often non-invasive fashion. <br> <br>The main challenge in performing colon and rectal surgery is to achieve an optimal blood supply to the prostatic area through the pelvic arteries. <br> <br>Although colon and rectal arteries exist in the area of prostate, they are rarely or never encountered during colon and rectal surgery. <br> <br>A major benefit of enterostomy is a significant improvement in colon and rectal surgical outcomes. <br> <br>In this article we provide the first experience of enterostomy after gastrectomy and small bowel atresia for colorectal backup. <br> <br>Patient outcome was determined based on colon and rectal surgery outcomes. <br> <br>Enterostomy as bridge between gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine system and colorectal circulation is a reliable and safe option for colon and rectal backup. <br> <br>However, enterostomy should be performed under a specialized team of surgeons and endoenterists. <br> <br>enterostomy is a reliable and safe option for colon and rectal backup. <br> <br>Enterostomy should be performed under a specialized team of surgeons and endoenterists.<br> Home » News » Will investing in biosimilar medicines in the United States make sense?

 are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during pregnancy? I've had a lot of experiences with the different types of dental services and procedures offered by Dr. Amir Ahmad, so as a patient who has previously experienced all four major types of dental care, this is my opinion on the differences between those who have received services from Dr. Amir Ahmad, and those who haven't. In the end of the article, I share some of my personal experience in terms of both the quality of my dental care, and the cost of my care. It was important to me to include these two factors because many patients assume they can get the same dental care from other dentists or dental offices. However, one of the biggest differences I see among patients getting their dental work done at dental offices is that patients who visit those offices are not always treated for the same amount of time as the patients who come from out-of-the-area. The patient who comes in for his first visit is usually a patient who needs his teeth pulled, or maybe he just wants a few fillings done. And then after the initial treatment is completed, the patient schedules an additional appointment when he feels like it, usually right before or after he gets sick. While this may seem like a small difference, the total time of the patient's first visit to Dr. Amir Ahmad's office is significantly less than the amount of time a patient spends getting his teeth cleaned or a complete mouth examination at another dentist or dental office. This difference speaks volumes about the quality of dental care offered at Dr. Amir Ahmad's practice, especially considering the cost of dental care.

When it comes to food and beverage processing, the United States ranks near the top of the global packaging industry, according to recently released data. According to the Packaging and Processing Worldwide Study published by Packaging World, the United States produces more than half of all packaging waste sent to landfill sites. While much of that plastic is recycled, a large percentage ends up in the world's oceans.
The U.S. generates enough plastic waste to fill about four soccer fields every week. In addition to the millions of tons of non-recyclable plastic waste that ends up in our oceans, millions of tons of food wrap, food containers, straws, cups and plates end up in landfills each month. The study reveals some disturbing facts about how the food and beverage industry uses packaging, from the amount of waste generated during processing to the amount of plastic waste ending up in our landfills each year.
Most importantly, the study shows that the food industry has a profound impact on our environment. That impact extends far beyond disposable plastics. While disposable plastics constitute only a small percentage of the packaging used in food and beverages, they can still make a difference in landfills, oceans and littered streets.
According to Packaging World's latest figures, the U.S. produces over 2.7 million tons of packaging waste annually. That is more than four times what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates Americans throw away each year in their trash bags.
The report's findings paint a disturbing picture of packaging waste from the food and beverage industry. About two thirds of total U.S. food package volume goes into one or both of two types of containers: 1) clear-topped containers, like bottles and juice cartons, and 2) opaque-topped containers, which are often referred to as food wrappers. Clear-topped containers have a higher level of contamination than opaque-topped containers.
The amount of food and beverage packaging waste generated annually from food and beverage manufacturing alone has increased more than 100 percent since 2012. While there may be several reasons for that increase, the biggest contributor is likely growth in food and beverage processing. Between 2012 and 2017, the number of people employed in the food and beverage sector grew by 7 percent. That means we are seeing new food businesses emerge each year. As those new business

 \section{Introduction}


Recent years have seen a surge in the use of neural networks for image classification. The success of deep learning networks has been attributed to their capability of learning feature representations from large data sets~\cite{lecun1989backpropagation,huang2020deep}. Conventional neural networks, which learn directly from data without using an intermediate representation layer, can exhibit difficulties in classification of complex images such as facial expressions.
 In many applications, feature-based image classifiers outperform simple classifiers, but are typically computationally prohibitive. Hence, researchers have sought to develop methods of training neural network models faster than previous methods. In this article, we explore some recent advances in training techniques that are designed to improve neural network model performance while reducing training time.

\section{Neural network training techniques}
\label{sec:training}
\textbf{Advances in training data generation:} 
As training data became more accessible over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of publications describing different neural network training approaches. Researchers have sought to automate the generation of training data with the goal of reducing the computational cost of training neural networks. Two main types of automated generators exist for training data: those based on pretrained weights and those based on data sampled during test time.

Previously trained weight-based generators are attractive because it is relatively easy to generate training samples by feeding a pretrained weight into a training process. Training samples that are generated in this fashion are referred to as {\em labeled training samples}, since they have been specifically collected and labeled for training. Examples of weight-based generators are autoencoders~\cite{scholkopf1997autoencoder}, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)~\cite{bishop1995pattern}, GANs~\cite{goodfellow2014generative}, etc. Because pretrained weights are necessary to run these generators, there is an additional overhead in training these generators.

In contrast, generators based on sampled data during testing time are useful because it is possible to feed unlabeled training samples at the very beginning of a training process without affecting the outcome of training, and then stop the training process once the model's predictions for unlabeled training samples match the labels of those samples. One benefit of this approach is that it enables researchers to rapidly collect sufficient unlabeled training examples without the need for pretraining; another benefit is that it does not require the collection of labeled training data for each individual example. Although sampled data generation is often difficult, there has recently been increased interest in sampled data generation for training deep neural networks~\cite{duke2016sample}.

\noindent\textbf{Sampled data generation: a new direction for neural network training?}
One way to alleviate the computational burden of neural network training is to collect more labeled training data at the beginning of the training process. Alternatively, one can reduce the complexity of training algorithms used in generating labeled training data by sampling training data during testing time. This paper investigates how two-stage sampling and two-stage training methods can alleviate both of these challenges.

In the first stage, a set of samples is labeled for training using a pretrained weight. In the second stage, the trained weight is updated by computing gradient descent steps during testing time. The advantage of the first stage is speed up of training, while the disadvantage of the second stage is increased generalization error of the trained weight. However, two-stage sampling and two-stage training methods may result in better performance in terms of accuracy and generalization ability than single-stage sampling or single-stage training.
\subsection{Two-stage sampling: sampled label-free training data}
To investigate whether training with sampled label-free data can be cost effective, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis comparing training with label-free training data against training with labeled data. We hypothesized that samples labeled during test time will provide valuable information about when and where training data was collected. In order to accurately predict the amount of training data used for model construction, samples collected during test time must be annotated with relevant model-related information.

 no? There's something magical about the holiday season.. in my family, it begins when my younger brother and his girlfriend moved into their first apartment. I remember waking up Christmas morning with the most joyous feeling every year in my heart. It is like an internal alarm clock : the hour has struck and all you can do is wait in anticipation.
The day after Thanksgiving, I usually have some kind of sweet treat in the house: cake, cookies, pie, whatever sounds good at that moment! While the pumpkin spice latte is perfect and has everything a coffee lover craves, I am going to be the first to admit this is not a traditional holiday cupcake recipe.
These Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies are more of a decadent treat than a dessert or snack. For the record, I adore both. This is a gluten-free recipe, as I do not eat wheat. If the dough looks dry at first, add water a teaspoon at a time until the batter looks thin and pasty.
Do these cookies taste pumpkin flavored? No, they don't. But they do taste very chocolaty, with hints of pumpkin, sugar, and spices. If you want a pumpkin flavor, add the pumpkin puree at the end of cooking instead of the dry flaked pumpkins seeds. A deformity of the neck of the astragalus (NAC) is commonly seen in athletes with running injuries such as sprains, contusions, and overuse. The majority of cases require immobilization in an acute stage for functional recovery. When the plantar surface of the NAC is compressed, the tibial tuberosity may be irradiated. In addition, if the tibial tuberosity is irradiated, then the tibial plate itself may be irradiated. However, the tibial plate may also be exposed to radiation during acetabular labral repair; therefore, it is important to understand how tibial plate exposure affects radiographic alignment during acetabular labral repair. Using a 3 T MRI system, radiographic alignment was evaluated during acetabular labral repair. In addition, tibial plate thickness and tibial component placement were measured for acetabular labral repair.
Bony defects were detected during 3 T MRI in patients with osteoarthritis dissecans. Tibial component placement during acetabular labral repair was determined by 3 T MRI, and tibial plate thickness was measured for functionalalignment purposes. During acetabular labral repair, tibial component placement was performed with tibial plate thickness and tibia plate orientation measurements obtained using 3 T MRI.
Improvements in functional recovery outcomes of tibial component placement and tibial plate orientation measurements during acetabular labral repair are possible. A 7-year-old boy, who was diagnosed with cancer, is receiving support from the Child Health Computing System (CHCS).
This child is from an urban environment and is able to attend a public school system. However, his medical care is being provided by a community-based setting. In addition, the child does not speak English as a primary language.
The Child Health Computing System (CHCS) contains information on children who have chronic medical conditions, requiring complex medical therapy. CHCS also includes information about children who have special health care needs, such as mental retardation, and children who are hearing impaired. Data collected annually in each state is merged with data collected throughout the nation from birth certificates. The combined data provide the foundation for many analyses and reports about children's health care use and health care benefits.

 The hospital was opened on July 31st, 1994 under the name "Holy Cross", after the name of Saint George the patron saint of Greece; it changed its name later in honor of St. George the protector against plague and smallpox.s The opening ceremony of the hospital took place on August 27th, 1994; the hospital is located in the area of Chania known as the Old Town.

Perfect for any bride who loves a bit of glam! In the 19th century, many American families lived in small towns and had only one child each, often in a family of five or six children. But these days, we expect two or more children from single parents, especially if their parents divorced or are separated.
Today's children need big, supportive families where they can develop in an environment free of stress. But they also need moms and dads who provide stability for them during hard times and who help them cope with difficult family situations such as parents' deaths or family breakdowns. Today, the world's population reaches almost 7 billion people. Many of us have multiple caregivers taking care of our needs at home. With a growing number of caregiver burdens comes an increase in abuse and neglect. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 20% of adults over the age of 65 report elder abuse. Abandoning a spouse, child or parent may be difficult, but it is not an end to the world. Caregiver burden is often exacerbated by loneliness, isolation, and financial insecurity. It's time we address these factors so caregiving can become an empowering act.
Caregiver burden has been documented in studies that compare caregiver burdens among the frail elderly and frail non-elderly adults. Caregiver burden is typically associated with loneliness and isolation, and it's a factor in the development of dementia in non-elderly adults. Loneliness and isolation are also related to depression and decreased survival among older patients with cancer and pneumonia. Lonely, isolated, and overwhelmed adults are less able to cope with caregiver burden. And as we age, we rely on caregivers more heavily.
Are there coping mechanisms that enable caregivers to make ends meet and continue caring for loved ones? Can they continue to fulfill caregiver roles without neglecting themselves? There are several ways to decrease caregiver burden, some of which require additional resources (e.g. transportation and childcare), while others do not. Caregivers can decrease their burdens by reducing financial and emotional burdens, increasing physical and emotional health resources, and increasing availability of services and supports.
Making ends meet means having enough money to cover basic living expenses, maintain adequate housing, avoid rent arrears, receive adequate public benefits, and save enough money for unexpected needs. Increasing financial resources is essential because financial stress can trigger depressive symptoms and depression itself can have negative effects on quality of life and shorten survival at advanced ages. The financial burden of caregiver role declines as caregivers age. In fact, when caregivers reach 80 years of age, financial burden is 30% less than for those older than 70. This study confirms that financial resources affect caregiver burden among the frail elderly. However, the 80+ year olds, who are in good health, experience lower burden among those who are elderly.
Limited availability of childcare is a major barrier to workforce participation among unmarried parents with young children. However, for

A longtime reader of this blog asked about the effects of a blood pressure reduction in women with coronary disease. I did some digging and was surprised at how little information there is about this topic. A recent study from Scotland, however, suggests that reducing blood pressure may be one way to protect against strokes and deaths among older patients. The authors compared stroke patients who were on medication to patients who weren't. patients taking statins also appeared to benefit from a blood pressure reduction. The study looked at 5012 patients between 80 and 90 years old in 41 different hospitals.

Homeowners are seeking to protect their properties by repairing roofs following major weather events. In response to these requests, the Cities of Haines City and Winter Haven continue to operate two storm roofing programs. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIH-SS) was developed as a measure of stroke patients' functional outcome. It was designed to be objective and nontriple comparison between stroke patients' outcome after stroke. However, it does not include measures of stroke patients' experience of stroke, recovery, and long-term functional outcome. As a result, stroke patients' quality of life, experience of stroke, and recovery are difficult to assess.
The primary aim of this study was to develop a measure of stroke patients' quality of life based on their self-reported experiences of stroke. We hypothesized that this measure would predict long-term functional outcome in stroke patients. Our secondary goal was to develop measures of stroke patients' recovery. We also hypothesized that recovery from stroke will vary by patient characteristics. Finally, we sought to identify patient characteristics associated with worse functional outcome after stroke.
We developed and tested an online questionnaire (OQI) as a measure of stroke patients' quality of life. We then administered the OQI as a measure of stroke patients' recovery in a sample of stroke patients who participated in a semistructured interview about their stroke. We used analysis of covariance to test whether there were differences in stroke patients' quality of life and long-term functional outcome depending on whether the OQI was administered as a measure of stroke patients' recovery or quality of life. We also conducted multidisciplinary seminars to train health care staff members in using the OQI as a measure of stroke patients' recovery. These seminars led to improved use of the OQI as a measure of stroke patients' recovery at the beginning of the poststroke period.
Six hundred and thirty-four stroke patients completed the self-assessment of stroke patients' quality of life using the OQI at some time during the poststroke period. Thirty-two percent reported having a good quality of life, while 24% of stroke patients had a poor quality of life. Patients with better quality of life reported better functional outcomes after stroke, independent of cognitive ability, age, or education level. Patient characteristics related to worse functional outcome after stroke included fewer years of education, living in an urban environment, and having a stroke with cognitive deficits. We found no evidence that stroke patients' quality of life predicted long-term functional outcome.
Although stroke patients' quality of life does matter after stroke, it is not related to long-term functional outcome after stroke. Future research should explore stroke patients' recovery following stroke. This recovery may vary by patient characteristics.
Is stroke patients' recovery after stroke related to stroke patients' quality of life?
In addition to the NIH funding from ADA:303414, PART of this work was performed in part with resources provided under Cooperative Agreement UB 30304. The Barefoot Prodigy is the first pediatric instrument to be developed specifically for unvarying finger-tip placement during screwing and drilling of peripheral internal carotid artery.
The Barefoot Prodigy™ will change the way children are taught pediatric instrumentation. Instead of relying on clinical experience, the Barefoot Prodigy will rely on an adult to teach kids how to accurately drill peripheral internal carotid arteries. Additionally, the Barefoot Prodigy will offer kids a safe and reliable place to practice the technical skills necessary to become effective perioperative nurses.
The Barefoot Prodigy™ will be available to all Pediatric Training Programs across the country. It can be easily added to any training program. What is an acceptable level of blood stress among adults with chronic disease?

The "Miracle of the Child" as the subject for a sermon on the Sunday after Epiphany is an invitation to meditate on our relationship with children. Both the "miraculous child" and his or her parents are the object of God's special attention. God is "mighty to do good." Children are special, unique beings who need us to love them. Children have a special place in our hearts. And parents have a special role in caring for their own child. Parents may often find themselves struggling to meet the physical, emotional, spiritual and even financial needs of their child, while still trying to be faithful servants of the Lord. God's Word gives hope for our children's eternal salvation and we should look at the "miraculous child" and see God's grace being extended toward each one. We can see the miraculous nature of the Gospel from the perspective of a child. God has given all of us a special place in His heart for children and this is not accidental, but rather planned by God. For the sake of the little ones we will consider four stories of God's great love for children and ask the question: Why does He give all of us a place in His heart for children? 1. "I am doing a new thing" (Isa. 43:18). Isaiah saw a future time when God would pour out His Spirit on all flesh. Children were part of that great new thing that God was about to do. (Isa. 51:9; 52:7-8) In Isaiah's day Israel had only been able to enjoy the Lord Jesus Christ and God's word for 40 long years (Isa. 6:7), but now Isaiah prophesied of a future time when God would pour out His Spirit for all nations. God had given all of us a place in His heart for children because He wanted all of us to be there too! What an awesome promise for those who have experienced rejection, betrayal and exclusion from the "church" system of the world around us. No matter where we come from, no matter what we looked like or how God feels about us, God wants all of us to be in His presence. Jesus Christ wants all of us in his loving care, and in this age He will pour out His Holy Spirit on every person so they may know Him personally as their Savior and Lord. Isaiah had seen these wonderful words: "In my Father's house are many mansions. If it were not so I might have told you then...and I might have spared you grief..." (Isa. 66:20) Jesus promised Isaiah he would soon return to earth and He would re-open Isaiah's prophetic vision. Isaiah didn't know that God would do that for him until the end of his life. But in the meantime God had given Isaiah a future vision of heaven and God's grace for children. In God's plan the "church" system of the world around us had done some things right in the past, but for most people they had failed miserably. So the future vision Isaiah saw showed the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord's spirit on the people of Israel. He had seen the promise of the day when the children of all nations would worship and serve the LORD their God in Jerusalem. Isaiah's vision of that future time in which children everywhere would be saved by the grace of God and would serve the LORD our God showed God's great love and concern for children. There is something about children's lives that makes God want them more than any other group of human beings. Even in the midst of all God has done for us, the "miracle" of the child has kept drawing God closer to us. 2. The great commission "Give all" (Luke 10:1). The first coming of Jesus Christ and the Great Commission He gave to His disciples show God's great love and concern for children. At a time in history when people were trying to destroy the "church" system and it seemed God was allowing it to happen God saw the "church" system of the world around us and took action. Luke shows us God wanted all of us to be saved by the grace of God and live our entire lives serving and trusting in Him alone as Savior and Lord. God wants all of us to be saved and to live life fully for Him. The gospel "mission" of the church of Jesus Christ is an urgent call to repentance and faith for all the people of God

 For the first time in my life I am getting married. The couple I am marrying has a home I have lived in for more than half of my life. When we met online in the early months of this year, our lives were drastically different. We were both working very, very full-time jobs. and we had young children at the time of meeting each other. We had just moved out into our own apartments. and the kids were not yet school age.. In June, right after we were done with our second children's birthday parties, we decided to start dating. A few weeks later, the kids celebrated their third birthdays together. It was during these three months that our paths crossed, and now one year later I am getting married.

The apartment is still just a place for us to sleep; it is not what most people call "home." When you live alone with someone who is so into home and decoration like me, any space you enter has to be special, must be special.

Because of all this, when I began designing our wedding aisle for the ceremony, it took me an entire day to draw it out because I had to get every single detail perfect: What color paint would she want her dress to be? Do they need a chalkboard sign? Will we use candles for some things or oil lamps for others?

I thought about how I wanted things to look for several days before actually beginning design, but still the plans kept changing. I had planned on an archway of flowers leading to the aisle where our wedding pictures would be, and then it changed to a flower-less archway.

Finally I did decide on a few things, but those things would be kept secret from everyone else until the very end of the wedding planning process. Because I knew people's reactions to the decorated aisle, I also made sure to give them all a good amount of lead time:

Aisle painting:

  * It would take two weeks
  * It was done with acrylic paints using a foam brush and a paint roller, then let dry overnight
  * It cost $130

The aisle sign:

  * It was designed as a DIY project: a 24-hour tutorial available online
  * Cost $25
  * You need a glue gun and a piece of scrap wood
  * I also created a printable version of the aisle sign online here.
  * You can easily print your own version by copying and printing off the printable sheet.

The aisle-length ruffle ribbon:

  * I had 24-hour access to Amazon to buy it, which was kind of fun (and saved me lots of time!).
  * It came with a 90-day warranty and a lifetime guarantee
  * Cost $100

The centerpieces:

  * I had 24-hours access to Target to find unique centerpiece ideas that complemented our theme
  * We wanted things that were not overly formal and were able to change colors if necessary.
  * There are so many great ideas out there! This post has tons of options
  * You can browse through the entire list of my favorite wedding centerpiece ideas here.
  * I had a hard time narrowing down ideas because everything looked awesome.
  * My mom and her friend (whom I asked to help) helped me choose centerpieces we liked best.
  * My mom got all the ideas on paper and made lists to send out to everyone so no one was left out.
  * We ended up doing this in a two-day period since my mom had 24-hours access.
  * I can't stress enough how helpful my mom was and how easy she made designing the wedding centerpieces.

The aisle runner:

  * I bought a $30 14-by-75-inch strip of fabric online for a little less than half of its normal price (at least I thought it was a lot less than normal price) and then made the whole thing myself.
  *

New Zealanders are being urged to be vaccinated before travelling overseas this summer.
The Ministry of Health is appealing for extra flu vaccines for travellers as part of a global campaign.
"We're seeing a lot of travel around the world. We're seeing travellers who have had measles, mumps and rubella who may be able to catch influenza," Dr Jenny Benson said.
"You don't need a doctor's note to book a holiday; you can go ahead with your plans."
Travellers should be vaccinated before going away. The public health campaign will focus on the need for everyone to be protected from the flu virus during the peak transmission period between November and January.
Dr Benson added that it's always a good idea to get flu vaccination annually - even if you've previously had the flu. "That way you protect yourself from any potential strains of flu. You also protect your children, grandchildren and grand-grandchildren."
Even if you haven't got the flu in five or more years, she warned people to still be protected against the disease because there is still a small risk of getting it.
"We are seeing the effects of previous outbreaks, so we need to do something about it again to protect ourselves and others from the potentially deadly virus."
Alongside the international public awareness campaigns run by the WHO, health officials are encouraging Kiwis to have their vaccines up to date this winter. ← Who are you to be judge of me?

. "We need to be careful as to how it's delivered."
I am reminded of a quote from 32-year old Ariel Binder, who is a student of the Talmud and writes poetry about her own spiritual experiences and struggles with her identity.
"I often feel like an outcast in my community, Jewish or not. This leads me to want so badly to belong in that way of life, but I never quite find my place. Every time I try something new, I feel a bit lost. Maybe some of this has to do with growing up in a religious environment and having internalized its values and beliefs, but then there are other times when I don't even know if I believe those things anymore. It makes it very hard for me to be Jewish. In fact, it made me question whether any of my family members are really Jewish too."
"I often wish to belong somewhere, so I find comfort in some of the stereotypes about Jews in my community - that they are smart and funny, that they're good at sports or music - but then sometimes I find myself wondering if they actually are smarter than anyone else or just lucky to have parents who teach them to play these games and study those books all their lives? And sometimes I wonder whether Jewishness itself is something I choose or if it's simply who I am. So many stereotypes are just labels on Jews: smart or stupid; good at sports or art; lucky or smart about money or dumb about math. Whenever I read one of those labels I feel very defensive, as though somehow it's my fault."
"In the beginning I didn't feel the need to identify as Jewish. At first I saw it as an ethnicity, like Asian or African American. But over time I started to get more interested in learning about the history and traditions of Judaism and eventually came to realize it was a religion rather than an ethnicity. I still identify as Jewish, though, because I don't want people to think I'm less Jewish if I don't celebrate Passover or keep kosher. I also don't want people to treat me differently just because I'm different, whether that difference is ethnic or gender. I also love being able to use words like Chabadnik and Chasid and not be judged by people's assumptions of how religious people should act or react. I'm happy to be Jewish and proud of that part of my identity."
Binder concludes "Jewishness is complicated, it can be a source of pain as well as happiness. When I think of the holocaust, I remember how people were forced to choose between living or dying. Many did live, but I also remember the hundreds of thousands who died by starvation, loneliness, abuse or neglect. It's a difficult subject and not a subject I like thinking about, but as Shimon Peres said during Yom HaShoah: "never forget, never forget".

Citation: Daniel S. Denton, Lori S. Wattenberg, and Cynthia A. Sears. No data exist in a study of college students' use of prayer books?yes; therefore no data are available?we presume that this is due to the lack of a systematic survey approach among college students. Nevertheless, the survey presented in this article nonetheless provides valuable insights into the use of prayer books among college students.
Is the use of prayer books among college students related to the use of other types of religious materials among these students?no; although it cannot be denied that college students may rely more heavily on non-religious media for spirituality than their counterparts in less-researched settings do?yes.

Canadian women over 50 should avoid unnecessary pelvic exenteration in cases of cerebellar astrocytomas?
Although pelvic anatomy has been modified significantly during the last century, there are still some differences between the anatomic structures of the female and male reproductive systems.
The pelvic anatomy of the cerebellum of the spinal cord contains one of the few anatomical differences between the two sexes (the other difference being in the uterine tract). In the case of cerebellar astrocytomas, we would therefore expect some variation in the incidence of pelvic exenteration among female patients as compared to those patients undergoing radiosurgery for this disease.
We would therefore hypothesize a modest variation in the incidence of pelvic exenteration among female patients as compared to those patients undergoing radiotherapy for cerebellar astrocytoma. However, after performing an analysis of the epidemiologic literature on this issue, we found that this is not the case. Tag Archives: Iceland
Iceland: Mini-Britain's Most Baffling Mystery
A car crashed off a roadside bridge in Iceland back in May, killing both its occupants — a couple from New Zealand who had just arrived in Iceland to visit their son. But what kind of road was this?
Another car collided with the first, so the police asked to see photos of the scene before they would send anyone out there. And while I have been staring at Icelandic police photos my mind has been wandering: What could you find in an old police photograph, which you might otherwise miss?
The police photos above are of the crash site today. There's a car, a pickup truck and a dinghy, plus a couple of people who were in all four vehicles. How did the police manage to get everyone to the same photo location within three hours?
They didn't. And it's not an isolated incident either. This one happens to be just the third road accident fatality since May 24 — although the police have still managed to send out a couple of dozen cars. Some have been sent out to investigate the site after a few days when the police are still waiting for the coroner's certificate. Others are just kept around for posterity purposes.
The police have not sent a car in three weeks.
It would be surprising if the police hadn't sent out a car for the site, given the speed of the investigation, but the photos below have been sitting around online longer than the police photos above:
Here's another car on the same bridge, with a little extra bustle:
Here's a dinghy, which doesn't look too different from the two vehicles above:
I guess police officers are just like us, they go slow for a while and then speed up.
I've heard of people driving away with a big "it was just a minor accident" sign on the car or dinghy, then driving home or down to the local police station later to claim the car was never recovered. So the cops will soon come to realise the car isn

Are there any health care systems that are as good at preventing sickness among their citizens as ours? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe they do it by having a publicly funded system in which the citizens can buy their own health care? Or do they do it by taxation that makes medical care a public responsibility? Maybe, but I don't know enough to say definitively one way or another. Perhaps one would have to find out from patients about the quality of preventative care they get while the other way around.

no, says the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The combination is too risky to give to premature labor in the first trimester without risk to the mother and fetus.
The article also reports that the combination could be administered via nasal vein in the first trimester and, if administered via vein rather than arteries, it is unlikely to cause thrombopressin-induced nephrosis.

 was the second oldest son of King Louis XIV and Queen Marie de Bourbon. He was born on April 29, 1648 at Château d'Eu in the arrondissement of Orléans. He was known as the "King's son" by his father because he was treated equally to his brother Philippe and they shared many privileges and rights as the Kings' sons. His childhood was spent at La Flèche where his father was governor. Later when he became the prince du sang, he accompanied his father on many military campaigns. and fought in numerous battles such as La Rochelle and Pontoise. His father died during his childhood in March 1653 and his mother became regent of the kingdom until July 1654. At age fourteen he inherited the throne of his uncle Philippe upon his death which gave him some rights as the heir apparent to the throne as well as heir presumptive. When he succeeded to the throne he received many new titles including comte de Perche and duché of Arques. At his request he also received the title of duc de Bouillon after his father the duc du Bouillon. He had a difficult adulthood; during it he lost many of his closest advisors. In addition he also had an extremely violent temper which he exacerbated with excessive drinking during his youth. When Philippe died in January 1670 he was only 21 years old. He inherited no titles other than those he already held; this meant that he was without position. His father left his son some unfinished business which he tried to complete himself before taking charge of the state: the pacification of France and the reunification of her kingdom. Because he inherited little by way of inheritances he relied heavily on his father's credit; he used these credits to fund projects and investments which he felt were necessary to maintain and grow his financial strength as king. His father left him a huge debt of 1 million livres which was not paid off until June 1678. He also inherited considerable debts from his mother. His sisters were the first to notice his increasingly aggressive and violent nature in December 1669 and advised him not to participate in some projects they had started for him. In early 1670 he began planning his own exit from public life to avoid conflict with anyone. At some point he also realized his father's debts were greater than his own assets so he decided to try and settle them all together in one debt arrangement instead of paying off each of his father's creditors individually. On May 1, 1670, he appointed a comptoir (debt collector) which worked day and night to collect the debts his father had inherited. He managed to reduce the indebtedness of the kingdom to about half. He then had two compères (debts collectors) appointed to do the same job for the duc de Bouillon but the debts were still too great. His father also left instructions in case of his death that he should continue to collect the debts he inherited from his father. With the help of his father's creditors he did manage to keep the majority of his father's debts at bay and was able to avoid fighting among them. He then took care of the state's financial affairs. Between December 1670 and October 1672, his financial decisions were followed faithfully. He was especially successful in avoiding the recurrence of some fiscal crises the kingdom had been plagued with up to this time. He managed to end the fiscal crisis which arose out of a dispute between his comptoir and the compte du roy over the distribution of the revenues of the générals. He also resolved the fiscal crisis brought on by the non-payment of the debts his father left behind by creating a comptoir of fiscals which would administer these debts on behalf of the Compiègne. During his last three months as comte de Perche, he managed to solve several financial issues as well as to create others such as the comptoir des perquisites (taxes) or les comptes de l'ordre (orders). He left his comptoir debt in the best condition possible thanks to the great improvements he made to the comptoir's financial operations and management. His actions resulted in financial peace and stability

Acer griseus is a species of ash tree found in Central China. Ash trees are often confused with maples as both can be considered "sweet" or "nutty" varieties. Some authorities consider Asian ash trees to be different species altogether, as they have evolved in drastic different environments than western ash trees. Acer griseus has leaves that are pinnately compound and are often 4-5 inches long. The compound leaves are divided into three to seven leaflets. These leaves are stipulate and often have serrate edges; this leaves them less susceptible to leaf loss in winter storms. Trees are usually smaller than maple trees but can be large enough to interfere with power lines. There is little variation in height or branching pattern among trees. Young trees can have a growth form resembling that of maple trees. The bark is red ochre color and furrowed when young, becoming smooth as the tree matures. As with many northern deciduous trees, autumn color in Acer griseus can range from greenish yellow to orange-red.
Acer griseus was named by Linnaeus after his uncle, Georgius Linnaeus, who collected some of the earliest records of the tree in China. The species name griseus means "gris", referring to its common name, "gray maple". This tree's latin specific epithet is derived from the Chinese character �� ("kang" = "grass"), reflecting it's close affinity with the native bamboo species. In Chinese the species epithet ��("kang") is sometimes added to the common name ����� ("gris") to denote a distinction between the two species. Acer griseum does not refer to the other Chinese maple, Acer schaalii var. griseum, a closely related species which has been recorded in northern New Jersey and New England.
Acer griseum is a deciduous tree with thin bark that is light grayish-yellow with age. Leaves of the species are composed of 3-5 (rarely 7) prominent nerves at their margins and are arranged alternately on the stems. Leaflets are 4 to 5 inches long and often 2 to 3 inches wide. During the growing season the leaflets are round or elliptical in shape and dark green above, green beneath, with a prominent midvein in adult trees. The leaves drop off during winter months as maples do. In addition, Acer griseum often produce large fruits of 2 to 3 pounds. The fruit is commonly called a "maple", a common vernacular used to identify many Asian species of maples. Acer griseum fruit is distinctive, having 60 to 80 small, edible seeds in 4 to 6 seedpods. These fruitlets are usually ½ to ¾ inch long and bright yellow or red. Like maple fruit, these are also frequently mistaken for maple leaves.
The common name for Acer griseum fruit is "maple". This is a term applied to a number of Asian species, including the well known "maple" in the United States. There are several native Asian species of maple which differ greatly from American maple species and are often misunderstood. Acer is an Old World genus and is closely related to Asian Maples (Malus), which were introduced to North America starting in the mid-nineteenth century as garden ornamentals. Many native species of maples exist today, but they are often misunderstood or misidentified. Many people believe they are all true maples, when they are actually a mix of different maple species. There are also large variations in the sizes, shapes, and colors of the leaves of common American maples (M. ser. canadensis). Many Acer species of maple have also been introduced to Europe and Asia. The trees' common names are often confused with those of native species. The most common mistake is to assume Acer griseum are the same species as Acer rubrum, a very similar tree, native to eastern North America. In fact, A. rubrum, is a separate genus with different species and a more aggressive growth

New Zealand's first medical student 'heroes': nursing students who risk their lives for others
18 Apr 2017 - 5:24am
Hiscoe, Sally
These students made up the first cohort of New Zealand's first ever integrated pathway training for GP registrars.
Norman Howarth
The first-ever training for general practice registration in New Zealand began as a partnership between the New Zealand College of General Practitioners and the New Zealand Medical Student Association in 1987. The aim was to offer generalist training for New Zealand students alongside primary care, so they could practise as a family doctor after graduation. The training is now an essential part of primary care education in New Zealand, with some 300 generalists trained each year.
Recently retired, the 46th cohort of general practitioners who completed this training were invited to present their experiences of training as a generalist in New Zealand at a special event on 18 April 2017 organised by the New Zealand Family Physicians. They had been awarded a 'first' for completing a training for general practice in New Zealand, making them the first group of New Zealand students to earn the right to register as general practice residents. Their training was led by New Zealand's first specialist in family medicine and an internationally renowned academic, Norman Howarth.
Howarth, a distinguished New Zealand GP, professor of family and community medicine at Otago University and a member of the International Liaison Faculty, has made training the family physician his life's work. Over his 40 years of teaching family doctors he has trained hundreds of generalists in New Zealand and has worked to promote quality assurance programmes in the rural towns of central and northern New Zealand. He also plays an active role in medical professionalism development in New Zealand, as the New Zealand College of General Practitioners representative on the Primary Care Alliance.
When asked why he thinks there is such a high rate of unmet family care needs in New Zealand, Howarth responded simply "because there aren't enough family doctors". There is a shortage of family doctors in New Zealand but Howarth says many young family doctors leave New Zealand. To counteract this trend, the New Zealand Family Physicians are planning for expansion of the family medicine training programme with support from the New Zealand College of General Practitioners and New Zealand Family Medicine Trust.
New Zealand generalist training for family medicine started in 1988 and the 46th cohort of generalists graduated in 2016. One of the graduates, Chris Cullen (who also trained as a phonological awareness early childhood teacher), reflects on the experience of training as a generalist.
"I have learnt something important during my time as a trainee: no one trains to be a family physician, they learn to be a family physician." Cullen, who works as a family doctor in Dunedin, says the first year of training is a steep learning curve, but the knowledge gained is transferable to other areas of practice.
"During the first year of training you are not expected to solve most problems independently, and the emphasis is on teamwork. You have to learn to work as part of a larger interdisciplinary unit and how to influence decision-making through patient and family-centred care. You also acquire the skills of communication, observation and recording in every aspect of your practice. In my opinion, the first year of generalist training in

are Medicare beneficiaries receiving inpatient Medicare Part A benefits in the 70st, 80th or 90th year of life? I always enjoy reading about the history of places. Can you share any history of the Duck Island area?
The earliest evidence of human habitation in the Duck Islands comes from pottery sherds, found during excavations in 1968 and 1969 by the Minnesota Historical Society.
The early settlers came to be part of an active trading economy along the Mississippi River. Early Native American cultures were dependent upon fishing and fur hunting. The Duck Islands became a major center of both the Pottawatomie and Ojibwe people who traded beaver pelts, fur-bearing animals, corn, and plant seeds with the Dakota Sioux. Many of these trading posts were on Duck Island itself. The Ojibwe began trading beaver pelts in 1701 and were known as "Five Islands" traders who traveled great distances.
The Duck Islands traders also carried down on their sleds large quantities of beaver pelts. These sleds were a symbol of wealth, power, and status for the Ojibwe people. They used the sleds to trade furs from all over the upper midwest region in order to accumulate large wealth stores. Ojibwe traders, such as Little Beaver, established themselves around the Upper Mississippi River in what is today northern Iowa. It was in one of these trading posts that Little Beaver encountered the French traders from Quebec City in 1710. The Frenchmen, who were in turn trading with the Dakota Sioux Indians in present day Minnesota, were so impressed by the number of beaver pelts Little Beaver brought back to them that they purchased all of Little Beaver's trading goods.
Little Beaver died in 1717 leaving his nephew, Thunder Boy, in charge of the trading business on Duck Island. In 1730 the Dakotas began encroaching on the territory controlled by the French, so Little Beaver decided it was time to leave the area. He moved his sleds and goods to an island to the north called Stony Island. This is where they would eventually build their own village. Little Beaver and the rest of his clan lived on Stony Island until 1732 when Little Beaver and his nephew died. After Little Beaver left this place, it changed hands several times, and the Dakotas continued to occupy much of the area up through the end of the 18th century. Finally, it was sold to the federal government in 1857.
In the late 1880s, a man named William Dee bought a small houseboat near Duck Island Lake. William had come to Duck Island in 1884 and decided to make it his winter home. He had a young son named Robert who he believed wanted to follow in his father's footsteps, so Robert bought a 14ft boat and started a small business as a mail carrier and ferry service between Duck Island and the mainland. When the Dees lost sight of each other while sailing across the lake, Robert became distraught and began to panic. His dad had never been alone at sea, so he didn't know how to handle himself. Robert was just getting ready to jump off his ship, when two big tugs stopped him and helped him to safety! Robert is said to have later become famous as the "Lifeguard of Minnesota," where he spent his days saving people from the waters of Lake Minnetonka. There is no evidence to suggest that the proposed law on the legal age to purchase alcoholic drinks is aimed at reducing underage alcohol consumption. It appears likely, however, that it will have a deterrent effect on some parents who may otherwise decide to provide their children with alcohol. We will examine the potential impact of the law in a separate article, based on the available evidence.
The proposed law was first introduced in 2008 in New Zealand, as the Legal purchase age for alcoholic drinks Bill [

nry yтn ryd nа You are at home, the patient is on a dialysis machine, and the dialysis center is in a distant town. But, as a result of the efforts of doctors, nurses, dialysis technicians, and patients, a dialysis machine is running at 24 hours a day and a patient is receiving high quality dialysis treatment. This success story should make it clear how important it is for patients with end-stage renal disease to be treated at home and how difficult it is to set up a home dialysis unit.

 In 1973, a team of surgeons set up an independent dialysis program using their own funds in Tucson Arizona (USA). They developed a model of home dialysis service based on self-management, which became a model for other dialysis units in the USA and abroad. They also trained thousands of people in the art of dialysis, the number of dialysis technicians in the USA has increased from zero during the early years of independence to over 160,000 today.
The 2015 Dialysis Outreach and Support Survey showed that the use of home dialysis treatment has increased dramatically in recent years. In 2014, 32% of Americans living with end-stage renal disease were receiving home dialysis, compared to only 8% two decades ago. This was an increase of 52%! The reason for the rapid growth in the home dialysis market was because the number of technicians trained by the early independent dialysis programs increased dramatically after 1973, allowing more people to work as dialysis professionals. The program was also very successful in making it possible for many people who otherwise could not receive dialysis treatment, to start dialysis treatment at home. Today there are 214,000 dialysis technicians in the USA alone.
However, setting up and maintaining a dialysis center on your own can be daunting and expensive. Even when you have the money, it's sometimes hard to find the right location. And without the support of the government or nonprofit organizations, it's tough to get the training and supplies necessary to run a home dialysis unit.
Fortunately, there are several home dialysis programs operating now in the United States - some large, some small, but all of them focused on providing access to high quality dialysis treatment. These programs also provide comprehensive support services to help dialysis patients reach their full potential.
Although home dialysis treatments are not usually available in the public hospitals, there are a few exceptions. Many home dialysis units are located in outpatient clinics operated by physicians, nurse practitioners, or nurse cystoscopists. The programs require some basic infrastructure, such as oxygen, ventilator, and neurological monitoring systems, as well as a bedside assessment team trained in the home care setting.
There are several types of home dialysis centers:
— Private units provided by family members;
— Outpatient units run by specialty clinics or physicians; and
— Community unit operated by social service agencies.
Most home dialysis units are small scale facilities. The average unit size is 2 beds, with a capacity of 5 patients. In larger units, with 7 beds or more, some patients may share a bed.
Midwives are often involved in the birth of a child in their community. The dialysis momma is the same midwife who helps deliver her newborn. That is why we want the community to know about the growing needs of our dialysis patients and their ability to meet those needs in a variety of settings.

Jeffrey Deutchman began his filmmaking career at the age of twenty-three when he produced his first movie, a documentary about the history of New York City's Central Park. Since then he has directed two short films, and his third documentary, The End of Suffering, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2008. When the babies are growing and strong enough to participate in physical activities, we can start introducing sports to them! It's a good way to keep them physically fit while also exposing them to teamwork and other aspects of sportsmanship. But with so many different types of sports available to kids today, it can become overwhelming to find activities they enjoy. That's where activity monitors come into play. Activity monitors can tell parents how much time their kids spend playing each sport so they know whether they're getting adequate exercise.
How do activity monitors work?
Activity monitors monitor kids' sports participation and use software to calculate their "activity intensity" during games. These are just some of the factors considered when creating a healthy balance between sports participation and childhood sports injuries. As an example, a mother may have a child who is a very active kid (participating in sports at an early age), but who suffers from frequent sports injuries. This mom will likely want her kids to continue participating in sports past childhood. In this case, it makes sense to have them participating as long as possible, especially if it's an activity they enjoy. If the family already knows what level of participation kids want to be involved in sports, then they can create a plan for their child's future sports participation, keeping track of the amount of time they're spending doing various sports, along with any physical limitations.
Do sports monitors measure more than sports participation?
Activity monitors aren't just designed to help parents understand sports participation, they can also help parents and their kids build strength and stamina together! Studies show that children who play team sports get stronger and have better endurance than kids who don't play sports at all. Kids who do both sports tend to become stronger than kids who do only one! Another benefit is increased confidence in athletic abilities among youngsters. Many parents and kids find it hard to accept negative feedback about sports, but activity monitors give both parents and children the power to make decisions about their sports participation based on scientific evidence. This information helps kids make responsible choices about sportsmanship and teamwork skills. They can use it to improve their sports participation, whether they're involved in sports as participants or as spectators.

A little over a month ago the world witnessed the tragic shooting in Las Vegas which took the lives of 58 people and wounded 583 others, according to the latest report from the New York Times.
The shooter was Stephen Paddock who, after a life of unemployment and marital infidelities, was a devoted gambler to whom the police are looking into whether he had any previous connections to violent crimes. He allegedly owned three guns — two semi-automatic rifles and one pistol, reports CBS News.
As soon as the shooting stopped, police searched the building, eventually finding 23 magazines and nine more handguns hidden throughout the casino floor. The police said they found "no evidence of a terrorism motive" and that the weapons were "mostly in working order."
President Trump's tweet about how bad Vegas has always been didn't go down well with many people. Twitter went into a tizzy and President Trump was not immune to the attacks, with numerous accounts retweeting and reacting to his message.

 The National Institute for Cancer Control and Prevision in Thrombopressin (NIC) is the scientific research institute of the Cancun Chamber of Commerce. NIC carries out research projects to reduce thrombotic complications in transfusion and in clinical practice. We are doing our best for quality assurance programmes in transfusion medicine, to prevent red blood cell alloimmunization in patients with hemodialysis and to reduce clinical red blood cell alloimmunization in transfused patients. In addition, we are doing a great work in clinical epidemiology, trying to avoid nosocomial pneumonia in hemodialysis patients. Our team is made by doctors and nurses who have many years of experience and they are involved in all steps of research projects: from the initial idea of a research project, to the final presentation of findings and conclusions at the end of a study period of two years. We believe that cancer prevention and control in transfusion are necessary prerequisites to avoid nosocomial pneumonia in hemodialysis patients. A reduction of clinical red blood cell alloimmunization would decrease nosocomial pneumonia in transfused patients and it would lower the costs of care. We hope that this report will make you think twice about red blood cell alloimmunization in transfused patients and will help us to continue to improve patient care. Newport Beach Resident, Kathleen "Kay" DeJarnette, is running for election to the 8th Congressional District seat being vacated by current Representative Ken Calvert as a result of his appointment to be U.S. Deputy Secretary of Veteran Affairs. A Newport Beach resident since 2013, Kathleen DeJarnette currently works in the Inland Empire as a phonological awareness interventionist. Before working as a reading specialist, she was an elementary teacher. She earned her Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education with a Reading Endorsement from San Diego State University in 2004. From 2005 to 2012 she taught in the Inland Empire, where she worked with a variety of schools, including an elementary school in the Coachella Valley Unified School District and an alternative school in the Perris Union High School District. She has also been a substitute teacher in the Rancho Cucamonga Unified School District and has served as an instructor and adjunct faculty member in the College of Education at California State University, Chula Vista.
In January 2018, Kathleen was elected to represent the 87th Assembly District and was sworn in on February 6, 2019. As your representative, she advocates for funding and support of schools, children, and families. With more than a decade of experience as a classroom teacher, Kathleen believes we need to invest in quality public education to ensure students succeed. She wants students to learn how to read and write, and she knows school districts can only afford so much. Her main goal is to work towards better public education and ensure funding for education is sustainable. She has sponsored legislation to establish the Perinatal Health Education System Fund and to increase funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).
Mrs. DeJarnette is proud to be a Newport Beach resident and a mother of three children who attend local schools. As one of nine siblings, Kathleen grew up in a small town with limited access to higher education and limited opportunities for career advancement. Through her experiences working as a teacher, her children will grow up hearing Kathleen talk about the importance of higher education and civic engagement. She wants the people in Congress and state lawmakers to hear the message from parents and educators alike. While her family is based in San Diego County, she considers herself a Californian at heart, and she'd like to make a difference in your community. The United States and China's international economic and trade policies are incompatible, says Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management.
He wrote a detailed paper in February titled, "Is there a trade war between the US and China?" He says the policies of both governments are to expand the size of the domestic market for goods and services. But he doesn't see any possibility of harmony between them.

 is sagittal molar relationship between sagittal molar and Bolton tooth-size discrepancy affected by sagittal molar relationship? This is an article originally written in 2004. It was revised, reassuring, and published in 2017. It is a message of reassurance to parents of teenagers who have been diagnosed with a psychosis and are now functioning in a full community. This message is intended to encourage parents of this type of teenager, with whom they may be reluctant to engage, to continue to do so as their child grows older and develops the ability to communicate with them. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designated three new Medicare Part A beneficiaries for 2008: 1) children under age 18; 2) children aged 18–30 years; and 3) children 30+ years of age.
 The beneficiary eligibility designations were made based on beneficiaries' ages, not on their medical condition or the payment status of their primary care coverage.
The HELPP program is an enhanced Medicare Part A benefit designed to address the long-term service and support needs of adults with disabilities and spina bifida and other developmental disabilities. A beneficiary may remain eligible for HELPP benefits as long as he or she lives independently and voluntarily in the community without permanent and severe functional limitations. The beneficiary eligibility designation process, known as "redetermination," is part of the Medicare Part A "continuity of coverage" program. Beneficiaries are redetermined annually for Medicare Part A coverage based upon medical, functional, and community-based evidence that their coverage is needed and will continue to be needed. This is the first step in the process of getting a new bike through the USPS route. At each station you pass, someone is checking your bike to see if it meets the rules of the mail system. If it doesn't meet all the requirements, then no bike can go in the mail. If you do get through and have a bicycle go into the mail, there are several things you should keep in mind!
In most cases, your bike won't go into the mail until it fits one of four categories of bikes. These categories make up the "mail system" of the USPS: motorized, manual, recumbent, or non-motorized. You can read more about these categories below. There are also some exceptions where motorized and manual bikes can still be sent. The most common exceptions are where your bike's wheels can't travel more than 9 inches off the ground and your bicycle has 3 wheels (which can have 2 wheels). These exceptions are sometimes included in the rules of mail delivery so check with the local post office to make sure your bike can enter the mail.
The bicycle category is the "core" of the USPS mail system. Bikes are classified as either a motorized bicycle or a non-motorized bicycle.
A motorized bicycle is any bicycle with a working internal combustion engine (ICE). All ICE bicycles must be registered as such before they leave the shop. This means that at least one of your tubes and fenders must be registered with USPS.
If you don't register your bicycle's tube(s), and your tube is lost or damaged during transportation, your bike will likely not be allowed through the USPS route. In addition, this registration is also needed when the bike is collected from the local post office. Check with the local post office to find out what registrations are required.
You can read more about USPS Registration and Transportation here.
Motorized bicycles are also referred to as electric bicycles. To receive this classification, your bike needs to be electric and able to travel at least 25 miles per hour (mph). You can read more about electric bikes here. If your bike weighs less than 20 pounds you can also get classification as an electric motorcycle.
Any non-motorized bicycle can travel at any speed on the roads of the United States. These bicycles are registered separately from ICE bicycles and the rules of the mail system have different requirements for ICE bikes than they do for non-motorized bikes. This means you can register non-motorized bicycles with USPS. The first time the bike is collected by the post office, all of

A: No, pharmacologic treatments for amblyopia can be thought of as a "non-drug" approach to behavioral therapy.
The treatment of amblyopia using pharmacologic agents can be viewed as a "non-drug" approach to behavioral therapy. Pharmacologic therapies are an integral part of the comprehensive public health system of care for children with disabilities. As children with disabilities age into adulthood, they continue to require a system of comprehensive public health services, similar to those used for infants and young children, to provide support for independent living. These services must continue to emphasize prevention, early intervention, family involvement, and community-based services (Mattis, Goslin, & Aiken, 1987).

Ensuring that every person who lives in Ireland has a valid residential address by the time of the census will require an estimated 300,000 households to complete the survey - around one in four households nationwide.
Volunteers will receive a full training course in survey methodology and will be provided with a bag of supplies and prefilled survey questionnaires. Each week participants will meet up to learn about local demographic changes over recent years and share their experience of shopping, cooking and eating out in an effort to improve data quality.
The voluntary program is open to adults aged 18 or older and there is no qualification necessary to take part. Volunteers may also be asked to participate in other research projects as the need arises. Applications must be made online through www.survey

Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 emotionally content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit? This is an important day of the Reformation. I have already written several posts about this day. But then again, I will write some more. Today I am happy to inform you about another day of the Reformation (but today we do it on the 10th Sunday after Pentecost). It is very often, during this period of time, we are speaking of men and not of God. Let us continue this day with the words of Paul in his letter to the Galatians.
 There is a great difference between those who strive for holiness and those who are holy as they strive.
 I mean this word holiness. It is one thing when we say someone is "holy". It can also be said of a man that he has "holy" blood in him or he has "holy" thoughts in his heart. Then there are other people who are "holy" only by name and not by nature. Those are a very common error in Christianity. For example it happens often that we call Christians people who are "holy" but not "born again". I am speaking of people who are "born again" by baptism into Christ Jesus. And so if there is a difference between those who are "holy" and those who are not "holy", it must be based upon what kind of birth these persons have had in the first place. We are talking of a difference between people who are "born" again and people who are "born" from above. There is a big difference between these two groups of persons. It is based on this birth experience in their minds.
The birth experience in their minds.
It is easy for us to see this difference between "born again" persons and non-"born again" persons, it is harder for us to understand why there should even exist differences in this matter between men and women. The reason is this. It is easy for us to understand this difference in women because we all were women once and still are women, right? But there is no reason at all for us to expect different birth experiences in women than in men. And there is no reason at all for us to expect a different kind of birth experience in men than in women. A big difference between women and men on this earth. Because of this birth experience a woman is a woman and a man is a man. In addition to this birth experience many other things play a role in this different birth experience of men and women, but these other things have little to do with this. And it is this birth experience in our minds which has the most important role in determining whether we fall away from the Christian faith or whether we remain in this faith.
If you look carefully you can see a big difference between men and women. If you look very carefully you can see a big difference between some women and certain men. It is a difference between the men who are married and the men who are not. In addition to this it is a difference between the men who are married and the men who are not single. A difference in the way they think and act in public and private life. But most important of all this difference in the way they think and act in private life. It is a difference between men who are married and single. It is a difference between men who are married and who are not yet married. It is a difference between married men and unmarried men. It is a difference between married women and unmarried women. And it is a difference between single men and single women. These differences in the way they think and act in public and private life cannot be explained away with the arguments given in the post: Women and men as they strive for holiness. Maybe you want to know how I came up with this idea of a different birth experience in men's minds? You probably already know that I have read all kinds of books and articles about this subject and then applied my own insights about it in many posts over the years. Perhaps it will be interesting for you to read my book The Spiritual Childhood of Men and the Spiritual Parasouling of Women? Perhaps you also remember my article "Men are born again before women"? Then maybe you can see some connection between these articles and your reading in this post?
I don't want to read a long article today. I don't want to spend all night discussing this subject. It will certainly make sense later and I hope it makes sense now too!
Maybe it may be worthwhile, next weekend, I have set aside for women and men, to read both sides of this discussion. And you can also listen to an excellent podcast about this subject which was released in October last year. But I really hope this discussion will not take place in my lifetime. I hope this discussion will end after we have read about both sides in this article and I hope

As a man who struggles with low self-esteem, it's not easy to admit that I'm weak at times — even when a friend asks me point blank for a date. So I didn't really take the request seriously at first. But the more she pushed it on me, the more my heart started beating faster. The more she persisted, the more I started to reconsider my stance.
Now here we are, days later, still on a first-name basis and dating again. And there's no better place to reevaluate things than in a crowded nightclub.
My friend and I have become buddies out of the fear of being alone. We both have deep-seated feelings of isolation, and we know the only way to break the ice is by connecting. Sooner or later, we found ourselves standing in front of a packed dance floor.
She asked me if I was willing to be her plus one this Saturday evening. My response: YES!
I met her at a friend's house earlier that morning. There wasn't a lot of conversation, except for the fact that I had a few drinks. She told me she couldn't go out dancing without me. That was enough convincing to make me join her at the dance.
And so we danced until dawn. All three of us. The PERSONAL CARE FLEECE CAP (CAP) is an innovative product in the area of medical headwear.
The PERSONAL CARE FLEECE CAP is a medical headwear product for intravenous administration of medicines. It is suitable for intravenous infusion from all standard intravenous bags, as well as for infusion via intraarticular fistula and can also be connected to any arteries without the need of a port. Because of its special design, the PERSONAL CARE FLEECE CAP enables effective IV therapy for hemodialysis patients.
The product is made of PURE NANO ACTINITE®, an extremely non-porous textile, which prevents bacterial colonization in the bloodstream. In addition, the textile is characterized by a high surface area to volume ratio and is therefore able to deliver high doses of medicines efficiently and reliably over long periods of time.
In order to prevent thrombocytopenia in hemodialysis patients, the PERSONAL CARE FLEECE CAP is a cost-effective alternative to arterial grafts and central venous catheter. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale is a modified version of the National Institutes of Health stroke scale adapted for use in English speaking populations. The NIH stroke scale evaluates stroke patients' functional abilities after stroke. These scores indicate disability levels of stroke patients' everyday activities of living, including reading, writing, and completing financial tasks.
In 2014, we were awarded an NIH grant to evaluate the accuracy of the NIH stroke scale among stroke patients who read the scales themselves. To do this, we needed to develop a way to accurately assess stroke patients' ability to read and understand the NIH stroke scale. We created the Read-Aloud Stroke Scale, where patients read the scale aloud while their reading comprehension partner watched for errors. We then corrected the patient's errors and scored the scale again independently. This study showed that the Read

It's typically used in ice cream and is added at the end of cooking so that it melts easily. The addition of fat gives creamed sugar an emulsifying role: a fattening quality, such as fat in animal tallow, causes fat-soluble vitamins like thiamin to be more effectively bound up in plasma protein. Thus, creamed sugar can be beneficial in preventing deficiencies of certain nutrients. the vitamin B12 supplementation and deficiency are a special area of research interest for scientists studying the connection between fat and B12 deficiency. Masks are an essential part of any costume. However, they tend to make us look ridiculous if not carefully worn. Therefore, you need to find a way to make them functional. Fortunately, there are lots of masks on the market today. Some of them are so well designed that they'll transform into works of art without making you look ridiculous. So, what is the secret? You have to find the right combination of design and material. Here are some ideas for DIY masks. You can always adapt these to suit your personal preferences.

#1. Mask with a hole for eyes - this is very common among masks. It's a simple concept, but the eye holes are usually in the middle of the face masks. There are a few variations of this design. For example, there is a black hole for the eyes. That means you'll have to add one more piece of cloth around your nose. However, this design works best in cases where there isn't a lot of breathability in the mask. #2. Mask with a slit for the mouth - this is often used by people who are having difficulty breathing while wearing a face mask. That's why there is usually no lip plate on the front of the mask. However, if you find yourself in a situation where a slit for the mouth makes sense, you might want to consider buying a new mask. Avoid ones with a single opening.

#3. Mask with an elastic band under the chin - a better version of the usual elasticated band around the neck. This design makes it easier to adjust the fit on each face size. Also, most of the elastics are soft and malleable enough to conform to different sizes of faces. If the design is good, then it will not cause pain when tightening or loosening the elastic bands. #4. Mask with a hole for the nose - another great design! It has a hole in the center of the mask to accommodate all types of noses.

#5. Mask with an elastic band on the forehead - most likely to make the masks comfortable to wear. The band does a great job of keeping the mask on during sleep or relaxation. However, make sure the band is strong enough to withstand the pressure of a thick head restoration. #6. Mask with a hole for the eyelid - another good idea for those who are having trouble breathing comfortably. Although not necessary for a full facial seal, the hole lets air pass through and helps keep the facial part dry. Just make sure that the hole is big enough to accommodate both your eyelids and the mask itself. #7. Mask with a neck seal on the front - this is very useful to have in case you have a facial disfigurement and/or deformity. If you can't see out of your nose, this is the ideal design for you!

#8. Mask with a neck seal around the neck - great alternative to the elasticated band under the chin. This design offers plenty of options to customize the fit. As long as the band sits inside the sealed neck, you're set.

We asked: 'do patients still have symptoms after 2 years?'. This is a very useful result for epidemiological studies. In addition, the time between reaction and onset of symptoms is short, usually less than one month.
 is a reliable measure to determine whether patients still have symptoms after two months? However it cannot differentiate causative factors (main allergen) that may have disappeared during this time? Probably not. The 14-year follow-up survey results are available at www.allergo.dk? The following is a selection of frequently asked questions regarding clinical pharmacy services. They are intended as an aid in the understanding and utilization of pharmaceutical services by clinical pharmacists.

In this episode of "Juiced: The Science of Getting High," host Steve Farber, MD, an internist and director of the addiction medicine fellowship training program at VCU Massey Cancer Center in Richmond, Virginia, and clinician educator Steven K. Wong, MD, discuss why psychotropic medicines are effective mood stabilizers in depression but often times unpleasant side effects can make them less desirable to patients. Dr. Farber also offers some insight into the relationship between mood disorders and cognitive impairment. Tucked away in the beautiful Adirondack foothills between Lake George and Saratoga Springs, Lake Placid, NY is the charming town of Lake Placid - America's winter sports capital.
The world-renowned Olympic experience was first launched here in 1936 when the Winter Games were held in Lake Placid. After hosting the games again in 1980 and again in 2002, we are proud that Lake Placid remains the home of many great winter sports events each year.

 CBRE Group PLC (LSE:CBG) has announced that the results of its audit for the half-year ending December 31st 2019 will be released next Wednesday, May 8th. CBRE's shares closed today at 164p and have a P/E of 15.27. Its share price is down from £180.35 yesterday and a year ago which means that it has fallen by -82.7%. This compares with a 2.1% rise in the FTSE 250 index.

The group's 2018 full-year operating profit rose by 8.7% as sales surged by 14.1%. This helped propel CBRE stock upwards with investors buoyed up by the improving property market. In fact it seems as if its share price has been on an upward trend since last August when it rose to 175p per share. It is the FTSE 250's second largest company by market capitalisation (next to Aviva plc).

 Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of depressive episodes in patients with depression different than the use of standard antidepressant therapies? The study design and results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Can cost savings be identified in this way? Is it possible to use atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of depression as effectively as the use of traditional, non-atypical, antipsychotics? The study design and results will be presented in a poster session and discussed in detail during a meeting of the international Society for Neuropsychopharmacology (ISNP) meeting on November 30th through December 1st, 2011 in Newport, Oregon.
A 2nd poster presentation will focus on the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of depressive episodes in patients with depression differently from the use of standard antidepressants. This second poster will discuss the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy as compared to standard antidepressant therapies. Results of this research will also be reported in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. If you've had enough of the winter blues, head down to the seaside town of Margate this weekend for the start of the world's only festival celebrating the history of the sea and all things nautical.
The Seafood Festival, organised by the National Museum of Coastal Research, runs from Sunday, March 27 to Tuesday, April 5 and takes place in two venues – the seafront promenade and the Hastings Maritime Museum.
Throughout the event visitors can enjoy activities including a kids' pond, sailboard races and an archaeological dig at Doddington Quarry. There will be a nautical food hall with specialist stalls selling everything from fish and chips to oysters and crab claws.
Margate has been at the forefront of the seafood industry since Victorian times, and the festival offers something for everyone.
A family day pass costs £15 (concessions available). Find out more information here. The following is my 30-year report card of events, achievements and mistakes: from 1981 to 2010. In retrospect I am astonished how quickly these events passed me by, while some have become part of daily life.
I have been able to witness more of history in my lifetime than many people my age. Yet I have somehow missed so much that I am ashamed to be called a historian: the Holocaust; the civil rights movement and Voting Rights Act; the Vietnam War and the Civil War; the abolition of slavery and segregation; the rise of fascism and the death of socialism.
In hindsight, it seems as if I have only just begun to understand America. It took me 40 years to understand one small aspect of our history: slavery, which has not been included in my first-year U.S. History survey course in my hometown of Annapolis, Maryland. Instead, we studied the Civil War and World War II. How did slavery make those wars necessary? Was it a necessary step in bringing freedom to the slaves? Not really. In fact, they fought for their freedom all along.
Even now, with the Black Lives Matter movement and the recent death of Eric Garner in New York City, I continue to be amazed at how much history remains untaught.
Amazingly, though, I have made a living writing about the past. I worked first in the public school system in my hometown of Annapolis as a science teacher. For five years, I wrote columns on science and society for the Annapolis Capital newspaper. Then I became editor of the school newspaper, The Clipper. After my daughter was born in 1987, I switched careers to work as

Our products are manufactured using high quality raw materials and modern techniques and are tested on various parameters to ensure their compliance with international standards. Apart from that, we offer customized solutions as per the specific requirements of our clients. We assure delivery of superior quality products within the stipulated time. HARVEY, Ill., Nov 08, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- North American Industrial Gas Group ("NAIG") today announced that it has acquired Gaseset, LLC a leading provider of gaseous hydrogen sulfide control systems. This acquisition enhances NAIG's ability to provide environmentally responsible gas generation solutions for oil and gas production facilities. "The addition of Gaseset's hydrogen sulfide control technologies reinforces NAIG's position as a worldwide leader in environmental compliance solutions for the hydrocarbon industry," stated Mike DeRamus, President of NAIG. "Gaseset's technological expertise combined with NAIG's experience and knowledge will allow us to better serve the environmental compliance needs of both current and future customers." Gaseset's hydrogen sulfide control technologies reduce or eliminate the formation of both odorous and corrosive hydrogen sulfide compounds which are produced during the natural breakdown of hydrocarbons in natural gas and which can contribute to the formation of other airborne pollutant particles. Gaseset's proprietary hydrogen sulfide control technologies are designed to operate without the use of toxic substances, in a manner which complies with the most stringent regulatory standards. Gaseset's technologies reduce or eliminate the formation of both odorous and corrosive hydrogen sulfide compounds which are produced during the natural breakdown of hydrocarbons in natural gas and which can contribute to the formation of other airborne pollutant particles. As a result of a change in policy, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale will no longer be used to evaluate stroke patients' cognitive abilities after the stroke, but instead patients' scores from the Barthel index will be used. The new scoring system will replace the previous system of assessing stroke patients' cognitive abilities. The Barthel index uses the patient's level of consciousness to determine how many tasks he or she can complete in a given amount of time, and measures whether the stroke victim's ability to perform cognitive tasks changes over time after the stroke.
An independent study conducted by the Department of Neuropsychology at Duke University showed that the new Barthel index does not accurately reflect the stroke victim's cognitive ability after a stroke. The study also found that the Barthel index was only useful in assessing the patient's response to a specific type of stimulus: light stimulation. In addition, patients' responses to light stimuli did not change after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Although the Barthel index is an effective way to measure patients' cognitive abilities, it lacks a reliable measure of patients' response to different types of stimuli. There are potential benefits of using the Barthel index, however; it measures neuropsychological deficits more reliably than standard cognitive measures, such as the Mini-mental

 They say Jack is pretty normal: "He will often laugh and sometimes cough. He is pretty sociable, but also has some limitations when it comes to sitting still for long periods of time.

This is the third part of a three-part article series that discusses the application of the principles of systems thinking to the analysis of medication error in 30 day data sets. Data quality issues such as over-reporting of medication errors, over-emphasis on adverse effects and over-emphasis on patient safety are discussed. Several system-level approaches are suggested.

An international medical humanitarian organization working in human papillomavirus prevention, testing and treatment since 1989.
The Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small viruses which can cause cancer of the prostatic plane, testicular planum and cervical nodes. Infection with these agents has been associated with cervical cancer in women who have immature neonatal tube dose or experienced nephrotoxic events.
Improved quality assurance programs and increased regulatory oversight of peritoneal dialysis facilities have contributed to the decline in PD mortality. Yet, increased mortality among women than men, may be an effect of timing of diagnosis; the use of antibiotics, while preoperative prostate dialysis, and the availability of high-risk sexual partners. We have made some important changes to our complaints handling policy.
It now states how we will treat any complaint received about our services, and explains how we will respond to your concern within 10 working days.
You'll receive confirmation of receipt of your complaint, and details of how to contact us when you need to make a further comment.
We will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within five working days and let you know the outcome within ten. If we cannot resolve your concern during this time, we'll advise you of a reasonable timeframe for resolving it. A 70-year-old man with early-onset Alzheimer's disease who did not receive adequate stroke care in a major academic center ended up wandering around with an intracerebroventricular node (ICN) thrombectomy, while his wife had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with strokes.
Two patients with acute stroke who experienced subarachnoid haemorrhage also had atrial fibrillations with normal ejected index count (2471 ± 467) before stroke. It was surprising that the patients with atrial fibrillation developed stroke without aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. ← Should there be a mandatory general surgery rotation in the surgical clerkship?

If you are looking forward to having a good quality of life with more time for yourself and your family and friends, it is high time you start to invest in yourself and make a choice of retirement living in a senior independent living communities in your area or city. The quality of life for seniors is a major issue nowadays and there has been a lot of talk about improving the quality of life for seniors.
Now that more seniors have retired, many people find that they can't handle the financial burden of being on their own for too long. The issue with retiring alone is the fact that you will most likely be relying on Social Security which can be a stressful experience if you don't have anyone helping you out. This is why, there is an increasing number of people who prefer to live independently but with the option of assistance in case you need it.
In the next several years, there is also a large population of seniors who want to stay active longer in order to avoid disability and chronic illnesses, and to continue contributing towards society. However, these seniors are unable to stay at home by themselves due to lack of mobility or health issues and are often forced to move into assisted living communities.
Senior living communities are designed to help seniors live happy, healthy lives with the freedom to do as much or as little as they wish. There are many benefits of living in senior independent living communities which include freedom to do things for yourself as well as being able to receive personalized care from trained professional staff.
The most important benefit of senior independent living is the freedom to do things for yourself. In order to keep your brain sharp and active while you age in place, you should have ample opportunities to get involved in the community in ways which suit you best. Many communities have programs available for seniors who would like to participate in sports, arts, hobbies and so forth.
If you are interested in more active forms of senior independence living in a senior independent living community, then try to join some of the many activities offered through your senior independent living community. Many of these activities are designed to stimulate creativity, problem solving skills and so forth so you can participate without thinking about how physically challenging it may be.
Another important benefit of senior independent living in a senior independent living community is the opportunity to receive adequate care and supervision from trained professionals. Seniors who do not have the ability to do for self, are at greater risk of injury and accidents which can lead to serious and long-term injuries. Senior independent living communities provide a secure environment for older adults who cannot safely live independently. Professionally trained staff are responsible for providing the highest level of care and service to seniors in a safe and comfortable environment.
There are many benefits of senior independent living in a senior independent living community, just as there are plenty of other senior independent living communities. If you are searching for a great senior independent living community

Dressler specialized in producing lightweight and high-performance axles with 2-axle version for the sportscars. He used his 190-mm-treaded stainless-steel axles with the following dimensions: inner diameter 6 mm and outer diameter 7 mm. 30 mm treaded axle nuts with M12 thread are available to be installed on Tespa H-411. We know from experience that a home sampling kit is an effective way to get people thinking about drinking water quality and making informed choices about what's in their tap water.
 samplers are non-invasive and easily integrated into every household in New Zealand. This means they can be put together quickly, for free, and without disturbing homes or households. This is important because it takes only moments for a family to gather a bottle of tap water and return it for testing at one of New Zealand's independent test labs. So you can have confidence your water sample has been collected correctly. ← What's next after colonoscopy?

How long does it take to perform an abdominal thrust as a back opener?
A new study finds that thrusts performed during abdominal decompressive surgery as a pre-operative step do not significantly add to abdominal decompressive surgery time. Is there a placebo effect? Does time after decompressive surgery influence decompressive outcomes?
Do we have any abdominal thrust experts in the study group?
Abdominal thrust experts are required for a successful decompressive surgery. Are the thrusts performed during abdominal decompressive surgery time included in decompressive surgery time? Is decompressive surgery time included in decompressive surgery outcome time? No? Then abdominal decompressive surgery is not an acceptable option for many patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the abdominal wall?

Here she talks about her journey. The HELPP grant has been awarded to Linda McBride, PhD, an Associate Professor at the Department of Veterinary Medicine and Food Safety, University of Copenhagen. Her project will be carried out in collaboration with Tivoli Vet, the Danish National Police and the Danish Police Academy, and its objective is to develop an educational intervention for police officers on how to recognize and handle suspicious behavior in people who may be the victims of crime.
"It seems like an obvious thing to train officers, but many of them are not familiar with the issues. This will help them to recognize more suspicious behavior and handle it better," says Dr McBride.
The interventions will be based on the recommendations of the European Network of Police Training Institutes (ENPTI). They will be aimed at the police's frontline officers and will be part of the police's normal training program.
– It will be a tailored training with both theoretical and practically orientated modules. There will also be a competence measurement tool included in the program so that the officers know where their competency lies. It is always good if officers are able to identify whether they lack competence before they are confronted with serious crimes, says Dr McBride.

These recommendations have been endorsed by the European Police College (POLCE) and the European Police Master's Schools Network (EPMSN).
Learning needs in the police are frequently assessed using questionnaires developed by the police's own training institute, the Danish National Police Academy. In this survey, 90% of the respondents stated that a tailored intervention targeting their learning needs would be valuable.

 The following table lists the primary pathways by which sugars can enter blood via the glieue system.
These pathways are classified based on their contribution to blood flow and metabolism.

### Pathway 1: blood gluconeogenesis in the liver
(from blood, gluorogenesis)

The primary pathway of gluconeogenesis in the liver is shown in detail in Figure 3. Glucose is oxidized to carbon dioxide in the formic acid pathway (FA). In this pathway, the ureidoglycoside phosphorylase is activated by the enzyme ureidoglycoside kinase (UGK). The phosphorylase then catalyzes the conversion of the urea carbohydrate to glucose dioxide with the help of a ureide carbohydrate intermediate. The carbon dioxide from the formic acid pathway enters the mitochondria of hepatocytes as a carbohydrate metabolite. The mitochondrial carbon dioxide can be used for energy in the form of oxidative phosphorylation. Since there is no oxidative phosphorylation in the liver, glucose is oxidized directly in mitochondria. This is the so called first step of gluconeogenesis in the liver. Glucose oxidation product carbon dioxide leaves the mitochondria via carbohydrate metabolites as a waste product and is returned to the blood stream by the mitochondrial CO2-sugar transporter. The glycoglycolytic pathway also takes part in gluconeogenesis.

Glucose oxidation product carbon dioxide leaves the mitochondria as a waste product and is returned to the blood stream by the mitochondrial CO2-sugar transporter.

### Pathway 2: glutaraldehyde deposition in the liver
(from arterial sputum, glutaraldehyde deposition)

> In the lung the glutaraldehyde is formed during arterial smoking and exhaled smoke. In the arteries of the splenic vessels glutaraldehyde is reduced to the inorganic form of glutathione peroxidase by reductive amination of glycoproteins in the endothelial cells of the bones of the splenic vessels. In the arteries of the external jugular vein glutaraldehyde is formed from glutaraldehyde disuciphil by hydrogen peroxide degrading peroxidases and aromatic amines. There is a high level of glutaraldehyde in atherosclerotic plaque of the arteries of the brachiocele and in the aorta of small and large calibers. A high amount of glutaraldehyde is also found in the arteries of the arteries of the aortic root in patients with hypertrophic cardiovascular disease.

The Lodge of Kirkcaldy, in the Diocese of Dunbartonshire, has been a charitable institution supporting the local community for over four hundred years. It is a self-help organisation and is a vital part of the social fabric of the area, working collaboratively with its members and others in their own and their neighbouring parishes.

The Lodge was first mentioned as an Order of Knights Templar (in Scottish Gaelic "Collaidh") in 1483 by John I, the King of Scotland, as part of the system of feudal dues used to administer his vast lands.  Collaidh may be translated to mean "Lodge" or "Meeting House", or it may refer to a lane meeting house. In its early years, this lodge was an adjunct to the Earl of Douglas's castle at Kirkcaldy. In the mid-fourteenth century, Sir Andrew Fletcher established his family residence there.  In the late fifteenth century, the Earls of Sutherland acquired Kirkcaldy castle which subsequently passed into the possession of the Earl of Southesk.  The Lodges of Kirkcaldy and Southesk merged to form the Lodge of Kirkcaldy South in 1625.  In the early sixteenth century, the order became extinct within Kirkcaldy itself; however, Kirkcaldy was an important centre of Temperance, a movement influenced by the Templars, which spread widely throughout Scotland between c. 1570 and 1834.

In 1889 the Lodge was reconsecrated after restoration by Archdeacon Hesilrige and became a regular chapel with a resident minister and an active lay membership.  The current building was erected in 1894 and has been expanded several times during subsequent years.

Facilities 
As a registered charity, Lodge of Kirkcaldy offers a number of social activities, such as lunch clubs for the elderly, a bingo club, a darts team and other social events throughout the year.

Notable members 
Sir William Cunningham of Balmallachy (a long time member), a distinguished soldier and diplomat who served under the earl of Sutherland as captain in the Scottish Brigade of Guards during the American War of Independence;

Hamish Graham MacDougall of Kincardine (member and later Master), Scottish painter, illustrator and sculptor, notable as a pupil of Sir John Hay Whitney.

I am an M.D. Pharmacist who is currently working as an Assistant Professor at the Pharmaceutical Care Department at the Università degli Studi di Catania, Italy. My main research area concerns pharmacy practice in outpatient clinics and I'm interested in developing models of pharmacy practice based on quality of service and outcome measurement. I have been involved in several projects aimed at the evaluation of pharmaceutical care within the context of the Primary Care System.
I am the Principal Investigator of a project funded by the Italian Ministry of Health (Risorse Sanitarie: "Innovative models of pharmacy practice: are they worthwhile investing in?") which aims at designing new models of pharmacy practice based on evaluation of pharmaceutical care. Furthermore, I am the Principal Investigator of several other projects related to pharmaceutical care within the context of the Primary Care System (including the NFPP project: "Nasal fractures: do size, number, and location of fractures have an influence on the outcome of nasal fracture repair?"). The Vega 5 is a high performance, single-channel, point of care test strips reader designed for use with all standard VLF testosterone measurements including free testosterone, total testosterone, free androsterone, nonesterified androstenedione, androstress.

by Chris Brown
The Trump administration's vow to review the nation's traffic laws means that cycling in American cities may soon see changes. Here are three major issues we hope the Trump administration will address.

Can America's traffic law system be reformed? It certainly needs some tweaking. As cycling advocates have long maintained, the country's traffic law enforcement system is archaic and antiquated. A new administration's promise of fundamental law reform has the potential to make things better. Here are three issues we hope the Trump administration will tackle.
1. Curbside enforcement
Cyclists routinely complain about police enforcement of traffic laws in major cities — especially curbside enforcement. We think the new administration should address this issue by making it clear cyclists will be treated equally under the law.
In an interview with The New York Times, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie expressed his intention to change the state's enforcement policy to "treat all road users fairly" after New Year's Day. In the same article, he also promised the reform would "end curbside enforcement."
Can you imagine police officers stopping every cyclist they encounter during a weeklong enforcement campaign? Or just for the week before New Year's? They might even be trained in traffic law enforcement to start.
These enforcement measures are counterproductive and don't work. We hope the new administration reconsiders its plans.
2. Cutting speed limits on streets with bike lanes
Many cyclists feel their safety and comfortability is compromised when streets have bike lanes. But is cutting speed limits on streets with bike lanes an effective way to improve cyclist safety and comfortability? Probably not.
After a study by the Federal Highway Administration found that 87 percent of local jurisdictions increased their speed limit on streets where there are bike lanes, the agency reversed course in 2014.
We hope the new administration recognizes the shortcomings of speed limit reductions and the need for more substantial safety and comfortability improvements.
3. A new approach to enforcement training
Ultra-high-risk drivers often pose very little threat to public safety. And yet, they often appear in traffic accident statistics. Because of the dangers associated with these drivers, many states have passed "drug-impaired driving" laws aimed at reducing their numbers. Unfortunately, these laws tend to be weak enforcement tools. For example, while the states of California and Oregon have enacted such laws, their enforcement has failed to meet expectations.
Luckily, a new administration's ability to reassess the national traffic enforcement system could provide a fresh start. If the new administration were inclined to do more than just t

 Q: Is there any way to make.NET 2.0 and up accept NULL as the result of the SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery method? I have a SQL database (SQL Server) that only allows NULL to be returned from the SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery method.  In other words, if I try and return a non-NULL value back to the calling code, it throws an error saying something like "SqlClient cannot convert NULL into a boolean".  
Doesn't this sound familiar?  
Does anyone know of a way to make.NET 2.0 and up accept NULL as the result of the ExecuteNonQuery method?
I know there are some solutions to avoid this issue using Npgsql or other SQL providers but what I'm really interested in is ways to make.NET 2.0 and up accept NULL as the result of the ExecuteNonQuery method?  
Edit 1: This particular error happens in this particular method call:
        SqlCommand sqlCmd = new SqlCommand("DELETE FROM [dbo].[dbo].[tablename] WHERE 1=0", conn); // This is in the SqlCommand class
        if (sqlCmd.IsNull()) { throw new InvalidOperationException(); }
        sqlCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();

I want this specific method to still work.  I don't care if it returns NULL or not, what matters is the calling code still works!  
If you look at the line where I check for NULL it actually returns a value but it throws this error anyway, so it's definitely not null:
if (sqlCmd.IsNull()) { return false; } 


A: You can always cast the SqlDataReader to bool by doing this:
bool result = ((SqlDataReader)reader).IsNull()? false : true;

You can also try this:
bool result =!(((SqlDataReader)reader).IsNull())? true : false;

But it does require casting the result from string to bool which might cause an error depending on your SqlConnection.
You can do the same thing with the data returned by SqlBulkCopy:
foreach (var item in bulkCopy.Records)
{
    //...
}

See the Microsoft Data Access Profile for more information. It provides a lot of useful information about how to deal with Nulls when working with Databases. There's also an article here that explains how you can get around the error by checking the SqlCeConnection.State property before calling ExecuteNonQuery(): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc243787%28v=vs.90%29.aspx

A: No, there is no way to do this without changing the SqlProvider itself (which will be a major change in many cases).  There is a solution to avoid the NULL exception using the Npgsql provider though, but there is currently no easy way to do this with the SqlProvider:

A: Just out of curiosity why would you need a special case for NULL results? If you're calling a database from a client application, and you have a method returning void for example, then you'd just return the empty string and ignore all results:
public static TResult Execute(string cmdText, int timeout = -1)
{
    SqlConnection con = null;
    SqlCommand command = null;

    try
    {
        con = DatabaseFactory.CreateDatabase().GetConn().Con

Mulberry's newest fragrance, "Wildflowers," debuted at London Fashion Week last month. The perfume is an eau de parfum, with an expected retail price of £32-£45, which translates into between $50-72. It is described as a fragrance with a "soft, feminine and airy" feel.
"Wildflowers" was inspired by the work of English artist Francis Bacon who painted some of his most famous images of flowers including the one above. The perfume opens with notes of jasmine sambac and ylang-ylang. It features sandalwood and rose, vanilla and patchouli, amber and myrrh, and iris.
Mulberry's perfume is also an homage to Bacon's work and the artist's use of oils. The perfume is also housed in a small bottle made of aluminum, the same material that Bacon's canvases were made of.
Check out pictures of "Wildflower" from last week's show here. Mulberry's newest collection is available now at Selfridges. Efficiency and effectiveness of sputum-collection devices in different settings: do they meet HIV/TB co-infection prevention and control recommendations?

The use of sputum samples for TB/HIV coinfection control in Central India led to community engagement around sputum-sampling education and attitudes towards TB/HIV co-infection risk among household and food shopping. Samples are collected by trained sputum collectors who are familiar with the sputum collection process. We examined how sputum-collecting behavior changed after sampling education and community-based sputum sampling among women who were living with HIV/STD in Central India. Will these sputum-sampling interventions lead to sustained reduction in TB/HIV co-infection?
Data were collected at two sites in 2008 and 2010. Participants included women with documented HIV status, sputum collectors, and food shoppers. Logistical support was provided by a non-profit sputum collection organization and sputum collection kits were provided by CDC. We assessed sputum-collecting behaviors, including whether they changed after an HIV/TB sputum-sampling intervention. Participants completed survey questions about sputum-sampling behavior before and after an HIV/TB intervention; responses were evaluated based on frequency and duration of sputum sample collection. Interventions included sputum sampling education and community-based sputum sampling. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis.
At site #1 (ISD), sputum-sampling behavior remained consistent pre- and post-intervention. There was no difference between sputum collector and food shopper behavior at ISD.
At site #2 (FTS), sputum-

The goal of HELPP is to enable students to plan a life after college, rather than just during it. In the world of data processing and analysis, it seems that most people don't want to spend time on the data acquisition side of things. They want the results to speak for themselves, and if there are errors or omissions in those results, it's usually someone else's fault. This mindset can sometimes be traced back to the early days of data acquisition. The idea of "data-driven" decision making really didn't take off until the early 2000's, when it was mostly an afterthought. Some people would make decisions based on what happened on past data sets, while others tried to create some sort of relationship between the number of events in a given time frame and the likelihood of something occurring next. We have made tremendous progress since then, largely due to the fact that we've finally started to understand the power of the data. Yet this data-driven mindset isn't always a good thing, because in some instances, it's almost always better to be big. There are lots of instances in which anecdotal data can provide useful information, but often it's not enough data to really drive some type of meaningful change. On the other hand, there's a growing body of literature about how big data analyses are able to reveal new insights and trends that can help organizations make more informed and data-driven decisions. Big data analytics can help organizations gain a holistic understanding of their performance metrics, so they can better identify ways to improve processes and outcomes. So why does having lots of data assets matter? To answer this question, let's first review some basic definitions.
The term "big data" can refer to any amount of data; however, it tends to be used in reference to large quantities of unstructured data. As such, there's a misconception that big data means unstructured data. However, structured data is also included in the "big data" category. That being said, the term "big data" has taken on a new meaning within the data processing community. Instead of focusing solely on unstructured data, data scientists now emphasize the use of a variety of data sources, including both structured and unstructured data. To better describe the nature of big data, let's talk about two important concepts: scale and diversity.
In terms of scale, big data refers to a wide variety of sources of data, ranging from big data repositories to the individual behavior of millions of consumers. This means you can find big data in many different forms, such as customer service records, medical claims, and airline reservation systems, among others. So what makes a data set "big"? It all depends on the scale at which one collects and analyzes that data. For example, it might be easy to collect and analyze some form of information from millions of people at the same time. It can also be difficult to do so without significant delays, given the limitations of the processing power available. For these reasons, some researchers prefer to focus on small samples of data in order to avoid delays in processing that can negatively impact the reliability of their final analyses. At the same time, big data analytics have proven to be very powerful tools in predictive modeling for quality control purposes. Big data analytics are also quite useful for finding trends in large volumes of historical data; however, many companies are still working to master this aspect of big data analytics. Finally, some big data vendors even offer big data software services in order to ease the burden of analyzing large volumes of data. A 52-year-old man who went missing in September 2013 was found dead Friday morning on the banks of the Mississippi River near downtown New Orleans, officials announced.
Authorities believe the man had been strangled and shot before his body was dumped into the water. The victim's family discovered his decomposed remains Wednesday night at around 8 p.m., and alerted authorities Thursday morning at around 7:30 am, reports KATC.com.
The victim's identity has yet to be confirmed and cause of death is under investigation by officials. Authorities are looking at both murder and suicidal factors as possible causes of death, according to WWL-TV.

I love movies, so do you? But did you know the special effects used in "Terminator: Dark Fate" are pretty amazing? So, what makes them so good? Let's have a look!
So, the special effects in this movie are incredible. There are some scenes where you won't even know that they're computer-generated. For example, there are a few scenes in which Arnold Schwarzenegger is wearing a prosthetic arm. This is a huge achievement as the prosthesis is so realistic. It moves like Arnold Schwarzenegger's own arm, which I think speaks volumes about how advanced the technology is right now. It's really hard to make prosthetic arms look convincing, but these guys managed it. Also, I thought the effects in this movie looked super cool. Like the scene when Arnold Schwarzenegger is on the T-800 terminator, running away from a Terminator. It reminded me of a comic book cover. It was a brilliant use of CGI.
There were a lot of great scenes in "Terminator: Dark Fate", especially when Sarah Connor tries to kill John Connor in the tunnels beneath Los Angeles. She's running out of ammunition, and I thought she handled herself well. It was interesting seeing her react to being in a life or death situation. The Terminators look amazing too. It's really impressive. There was also a fight scene between John Connor and the leader of the machines, played by Edward Furlong. It was very cool to see John Connor try to defeat such a powerful enemy, despite having no special weapons. However, I felt he didn't really have a plan.
Another thing I liked about the special effects in this movie was the character design. They really gave each character personality. Arnold Schwarzenegger's body had a lot of different details and I found myself laughing out loud when they showed him getting in his car for the first time. His car is painted black, while all the other cars are yellow. I don't remember seeing anything quite like that before. I also loved the idea of an elderly man fighting back against machines he used to hate. It made me wish we would get more elderly characters doing something heroic in films like this. It wasn't a big part of this movie, but it would be nice if more films made use of older actors.
I also thought the special effects used for the T-1000 in this movie were really cool. He has these red eyes, and it was really creepy looking. His face is covered in this weird kind of craziness, making it scary. If Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't your favourite actor, then I would highly recommend checking out this movie. It is definitely worth watching.

Whenever my friends ask me where I would go if money weren't an object, I am always tempted to say "everywhere"…but then I know myself too well and know that I have a definite list of favorite destinations (the ones I call "lifetime" destinations). I don't need an excuse to visit these spots but one thing they have in common is that they have changed my life.
This article is all about those places that have made me into the person I am today – places that I think of when I am feeling homesick or just want to get away from it all. So with that being said here are my top 8 lifetime destinations!
Prague, Czech Republic: This city has made Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, world renowned for its architectural beauty and artistic history. For some reason this place is also on every student's bucket list. The most famous architectural monuments include Wenceslas Square and the Charles Bridge. There is also the Vysehrad hill, which contains churches built between the 11th and 19th centuries. It is also home to the oldest beer hall in Prague, the Vysehrad Castle, and the former imperial prison that now houses an exhibition on the history of prisons in the Czech Republic. With so many beautiful buildings to explore and a delicious cuisine, Prague definitely fits the bill as a lifetime destination for many people. But what makes this place even more special to me is the fact that many of my best memories were born there, including the start of my love for art and my meeting my husband.
Dublin, Ireland: Dublin is a very old and historically significant city, having played a huge role in Irish history throughout the years. However, it is also one of the newest cities in Europe – it became part of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1974. Now it is home to many museums and art galleries and has a number of very famous buildings, such as Trinity College, which holds some of the best libraries in the world. And no trip to Dublin would be complete without stopping at St. Patrick's Cathedral and taking a look at some of the most amazing statues surrounding Ireland's national symbol. Dublin has some incredible cultural activities to participate in, whether you're into sports, art, literature, music, or just plain fun, Dublin has something to offer for everyone.
Vancouver, Canada: Whether you live in Vancouver or come down to enjoy the weather and stunning views, Vancouver is the perfect city to relax and rejuvenate yourself. Not only does the scenery of Vancouver make you feel instantly happy when you see it, it also makes you want to stay longer. Some of my favorite things to do in Vancouver include watching the sunset from Gastown and walking along the seawall in Stanley Park. Vancouverites also love the outdoors, whether they be hikers, kayakers, cyclists, runners, or walkers – there is a place for everybody in the Vancouver lifestyle. You can try to climb Vancouver's highest mountain, Granville Island, hike one of the many coastal trails, or head to the beach to swim in Vancouver's iconic deep blue water. Whatever you choose to do you will always have an amazing time.
Las Vegas, Nevada: Las Vegas has become a popular tourist destination not only because of its unbelievably great location in southern Nevada, but also because of its fantastic casino scene and nightlife scene. But Las Vegas's famous entertainment scene is by far one of its biggest attractions for both locals and

On a day that began overcast, ended clear and then started again as if a light mist, this photo was taken at a popular local watering hole called The Whistle Stop. It's the kind of place that has a "no photography" sign on the door. But there they are, these guys at the bar counter, sipping away, their backs to you, a light mist hanging in the air. Maybe you can make out my reflection in the glass, the clouds in the background and even the reflection of a bullseye in the center of the window. Maybe I was the one making all those faces and I got lucky being able to shoot this one. Maybe it wasn't. 03 Apr 2017 - 2:48 PM Updated: 03 Apr 2017 - 3:27 PM (repost).
April 2017 marks the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing. While all eyes were focused on the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, it is time to reflect on the role of lunar sampling systems in the Apollo program.
There are several different types of sampling systems used during Apollo. All of them were useful for collecting lunar samples, but not all of them were necessary or desirable.
The most common type of sampling system was the "lid" sampling system; the lunar surface is covered in rocks of various sizes and forms, and all the rocks must be handled before any lunar sample collection. This lid system can also collect other items of interest in the lunar environment, such as water and ice. However, the lid system is not always necessary; many of the lunar samples collected by the Apollo program are collected in locations without a lid. A few of the Apollo lunar sample locations don't have any surface area covered in rocks, so a lid system could be impractical.
Another type of sampling system used during Apollo was the "fountain" sampling system; the lunar surface is covered in sand and gravel, but it also contains rocks larger than 3 inches in diameter. A small stream of water can trickle down from the lunar surface and flow through a pump into a small "fountain" area. Once in the fountain area, the water will rise upwards until it reaches the surface of the moon; the water collects and cools into rocks of various sizes. This type of sampling system was not widely used during the Apollo program, and only a handful of Apollo samples were collected using this type of sampling system. Most Apollo sample collection occurred using other sampling systems, such as the "lid" and "crawler" systems.
The third type of sampling system was the "pail" sampling system; a large, receptacle like bucket is placed on the lunar surface and filled with the rock materials collected previously by NASA's sample collection teams. These samples are transported to the Lunar Sample Analysis Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center for analysis. The samples are analyzed by NASA scientists to determine what chemical elements the rocks contain and how much they contain. These samples are then collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who maintain a database of all the Apollo samples. The USGS has compiled a list of the Apollo sample locations, as well as the Apollo samples themselves; for some locations the USGS has collected both "crawler" and "lid" samples. For others the USGS has collected just "lid" samples.
The USGS also maintains an online database for Apollo sample locations; you can view Apollo sample locations by location name, date, location coordinates, and date coordinates. If you look closely at some of these samples locations, you can see that there aren't very many locations; perhaps the number of samples was limited due to technical or logistics reasons. The USGS also maintains data files containing more detailed information about each Apollo sample location.
In addition to the Apollo sample locations maintained by the USGS, NASA maintains a separate file of Apollo sample locations on the moon itself. There are two sets of these locations; one set is contained in the Apollo Gazetteer File (AGF); the AGF was created by the Apollo Program office and contains data on every Apollo sample location. The second set of Apollo sample location data is contained in the

VOL.23, NO.2, MARCH-APRIL 2015
Germans settling in Canada: is the population dispersal mode of culture transformation?
Gesellschaftliche Konskrimierung durch Auswanderung? oder Veränderungen in der sozialen Netzwerkstattung? oder Wandlungenkonskrimierung? (societal disruption by emigration? or changes in social networks?)
A NEW CULTURE FOR THE CANADIAN DYNASTIES?
Germans are one of the most significant immigrant populations in Canada. Many emigrants to Canada arrived from a "German" homeland. Can we explain their success and their embrace of the Canadian society as a whole? Is it a population dispersion mode of culture transformation? The study of this issue aims to answer these questions by investigating immigrant success in Canada based on the analysis of emigrants' life histories and their success in Canada based on the analysis of emigrants' life histories and their success in Canada. German emigrants success has been studied in various countries, and in some cases the study of success has been a matter of public policy, e.g., in Germany. Yet the research into success of immigrants who have settled in Canada seems to be an entirely new area of research, and until recently it has not received any systematic attention from either scholars or policymakers. Does Canada's distinctive emigration history mean that German emigrants are at a cultural disadvantage in terms of success in Canada? Or is the immigration history of Germans in the Canadian context an important factor for their success? In other words, was Germany in 1980 an appropriate country in which to study immigrants' success in Canada? These questions have prompted a systematic review of the literature. Will the answer of these questions change our understanding of immigration patterns of Germans and emigrants' success in Canada? We will discuss both in relation to immigrants' long-term integration in Canadian society. Fear & loathing in the 'bubble': a new form of media seduction?

In a world increasingly dominated by media saturation, is there a role for media criticism and scepticism?
Media coverage of the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver was predominantly positive. We might say the media reported the events in the "bubble", as if they were an untouchable space between competitors and spectators in which no "dirty laundry" was air-brushed.
Is it possible to recapture this pre-Olympic bubble? Can some media outlets, like Crikey, counter the media seduction and offer alternative perspectives and voices? What would it take? Posts Tagged 'Racial disparities in cancer mortality'

 Does the 7th edition of the Wet N' Wild water-based survival manual address the new threats we face in urban environments? Yes. Does it reflect changes in survival needs based on the input of survival experts and the feedback of survivors of recent waterborne diseases? No!
it seems more a response to the 2nd generation of survivalists than a true update to the original book written by Rae Allen. Allen has changed her name to Dianne Mullins Allen since she is no longer associated with a survival training company. In fact she says that "there are lots of survival companies out there" and "maybe my company was not the best" and "maybe there was a better way". The Wet n' Wild training manual does not address the common threats we face today nor does it address some of the new threats as mentioned above. It is also difficult to evaluate the training because it is an online training system and the manual is in PDF format, making it almost impossible to print out and test questions in a home environment. You need to download the PDF version and print out your answers. The online training does have the potential of being helpful but you will need a printer, computer, access to the Internet, etc. The training can also be disorienting as the questions do not follow the progress of a storyline but jump around randomly. Another difference between the manuals is the emphasis put on first aid and CPR. First aid is not a life saving skill in the context of a true survival situation. There is no first aid section in the Wet n' Wild survival manual. Also, the first-aid section of the manual does not address the use of adrenaline to increase blood flow during times of stress or to increase oxygen uptake. Also, it does not discuss how to treat acute and chronic shock. In addition, the manual provides little information about the psychological side effects of stress. It does mention the adverse mental health effects of stress. As a result of all this the manual is not recommended for use in an emergency. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: can its reliability be improved?<br> <br>The National Institutes of Health stroke scale's reliability can be improved by including additional data elements about the time of day and week when the stroke victim reports having the stroke symptoms. <br> <br>A preliminary version of a self-reported stroke symptom scale was created using an open-ended format. The scale was initially tested on 43 stroke patients in the emergency department at an academic medical center. Participants rated their stroke symptoms between 0 and 10 points; patients scored 5 points as having the most severe stroke symptoms.<br> <br>Reliability tests indicated the NIH stroke scale had adequate validity with stroke patients who were able to give and receive accurate stroke-related information during a 7-day period. However, there was variation in the frequency of stroke symptoms reported by stroke patients depending on whether the information was obtained during a morning or afternoon. This variation suggests that the self-reported stroke symptom scale may be an improvement over standard measures of stroke symptoms, such as the Barthel index and NIH funding source.<br> <br>The National Institutes of Health stroke scale was compared against the Barthel index and NIH funding source for accuracy in reports of stroke symptoms.<br> <br>Although the NIH stroke scale and Barthel index showed similar levels of concordance, patients received significantly fewer stroke symptom reports when they contacted a stroke center than when they called a family physician.<br> <br>The NIH stroke scale's high rate of missing strokes can be addressed by incorporating additional data elements into the assessment process.<br> <br>Additional data items include: time of day when symptoms first appeared; day of week when symptoms first appeared; whether or not the patient reported symptoms to a family member or friend; and whether the stroke victim was receiving accurate stroke-related information from a family or a professional when symptoms first appeared

Dublin, February 20, 2018 — General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, GE Capital, plans to acquire Baker Hughes Inc. for $17 billion in cash.
 The acquisition of Baker Hughes complements GE Capital's strategic growth objective of growing its financing business by at least $5 billion per year over three years. As part of this plan, GE Capital expects to continue its expansion of credit products for the oil and gas industry in addition to its current focus on capital projects financing.
 "We look forward to working with the management team and employees of Baker Hughes and believe the combined company will be well positioned to compete effectively in this very competitive environment," said John Flannery, GE Chairman and CEO.
 "Baker Hughes' portfolio of energy services businesses allows us to offer customers innovative solutions across their operational lifecycle. We expect the business to continue to deliver solid operating performance and excellent returns," said Mark Holly, Baker Hughes chairman of the board. "The combination with GE will add scale and strengthen our leadership position in critical areas such as oilfield equipment rental and repair services."
 The announcement follows months of speculation about a possible merger between GE and Baker Hughes. It marks one of the largest M&A transactions in GE's history. With headquarters in Houston, Texas, Baker Hughes is the world's leading provider of technologically advanced oilfield services. Headquartered in Bakersfield, California, GE Capital has over $39 billion in global balance sheet capacity. With more than half of its assets under management in North America, GE Capital provides customized funding solutions in order to help companies capitalize on emerging market opportunities while managing risk. GE Capital has 5,000 employees in North America and is a global leader in commercial banking.
"Baker Hughes is well positioned to meet the evolving needs of global customers for oil and gas exploration and production services," said Michael Pyle, President and CEO of Baker Hughes. "Together, we can leverage our scale, global footprint, and broad expertise to serve customers better."
 "This transaction represents a great opportunity for GE and Baker Hughes customers and employees around the globe," said Jim Matheny, president of GE Energy Financial Services. "It provides us with a platform for continued growth of our portfolio of oil and gas businesses, while enabling us to serve our customers more efficiently and cost effectively."

The 9th of January is a day to remember the birth of our Nation, and of the man who founded it. I hope this blog will serve as a reminder to all of the people who voted in favor of that declaration. that it means so much more than the words printed on it; it means an end to the idea of one man ruling the world, whether he is king, president or prime minister. It means that the will of the people shall have its way even if the might of a dictator wishes otherwise. It means freedom for all the citizens of Earth. It means life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
It means that we are free from oppression of any kind. We are free men and women. It is time to stop blaming others and focus our energies on helping each other rather than those who would try to harm us. May the blessings of liberty be with you always.
May your new year's resolution be to be better prepared to defend yourself and yours in any situation where the might of the police or other government officials may attempt to deprive you of these freedoms. This can be done by being armed and well-trained in self defense tactics. And by remembering that when you choose to do nothing about illegal activity in your neighborhood, you are also choosing to participate in it. For the second consecutive week, West Virginia's high school athletes shone brightly on the stage of success at the 2014 High School State Tournament in Charleston.
The Class AAA girls soccer tournament began Tuesday with the semifinals, and the tournament continued Wednesday afternoon with the championship game between Charleston and Parkersburg.
The High School State Tournament at the WVU Coliseum ended Wednesday night after the semifinal round with three girls soccer games and the Class A final between Charleston and Parkersburg. The top two seeds advanced to the state title game while West Side's girls soccer team fell in the quarterfinals.
Charleston earned a berth into the state title game after beating South Charleston 3-2 in overtime Wednesday morning and then eliminated Williamson 2-1 in overtime Wednesday evening. Both victories came after a 2-hour delay due to inclement weather and lightning strikes.
West Side finished runner-up after losing to Williamson 4-0 Wednesday evening after trailing 2-1 at halftime.
Charleston's overtime victory gave the Lady Cavaliers their first trip to the state title game since 1998, and Charleston's run to state has generated excitement around Mingo County. Charleston won six straight championships before falling to North Point 3-2 in the state title game during last year's tourney.
"We played good, strong teams this tournament," said Charleston coach Mike Tarrant. "North Point and Williamson are two very talented and deep teams, which is what we expected going into the tournament."
Though Charleston was upset by Williamson in the quarterfinals, the Lady Cavaliers made sure to stay focused on winning the title game.
Williamson's 2-1 overtime victory Wednesday afternoon ended a five-game winning streak and a four-year winless drought against the Lady Cavaliers.
"The biggest thing for me this year was making sure to finish off games with a win," said senior Carrie Stultz. "This was my last year playing varsity and making sure we got to the final game was the goal."
The Lady Cavaliers entered the tourney on a six-game winning streak after defeating Charleston 1-0 April 25 at home and defeating East Hardy 3-1 April 28 at home.
Stultz's game-winning goal Wednesday came late in the second half with West Side up 1-0 on Williamson's goal 1:55 into the game.
"The team got tired and they stopped working hard," said

t is the goal of the armed forces of most African nations to be integrated into the army of another country. As a result, most armies of sub-Saharan Africa possess the necessary equipment and training of operation.
 The Tanzanian Army has contributed troops to many of these operations, including those in Angola during the 198-202 period, Burundi from May 1994 until November 2000, Democratic Republic of the Congo from October 2002 until April 2003 and the Central African Republic from December 2007 until January 2000, South Sudanese from September 2012 until June 2014 and Uganda from April 2015 until present date. There are reports that Tanzania may deploy troops to Libya in the near future. A new report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC) argues that the region faces "a high risk of falling behind in the use of information and communication technology," citing that 80 percent of the population is connected to the Internet through cellular services as opposed to 60 percent five years ago.
Although the report finds some success stories -- like Chile's digital agenda and Colombia's telecom policy reforms -- it says there's still room for improvement, especially with regard to broadband adoption among the region's citizens. In fact, just one quarter of the population currently has access to Internet services through wireless connections, the UN-ECLAC report notes. Meanwhile, 90 percent of the population can receive broadcast TV services on satellite or terrestrial connections.
The report -- which was produced by the Inter-American Development Bank and UN-ECLAC's office in Buenos Aires, Argentina -- also found the telecom market in the region to be dominated by two companies: Telefonel and Movistar. As a result, "high levels of government intervention" have been needed to promote competition. While the report makes a case for increased regional cooperation among the countries of the Americas to support the development of broadband infrastructure, it also says that the development of digital skills among the public will be crucial to spurring regional innovation in the long term.

This weekend I went backpacking with friends over Labor Day Weekend.
We planned a trip all week long, with several overnights at various campsites along our route. It gave us time to relax and enjoy the scenery, without worrying about where we'd sleep each night. We spent most of the week hiking, camping, kayaking and exploring nature. But there were also a few days where we did something a little bit different. And one of those days was in Yosemite National Park.
Yosemite is one of my favorite places in the world. The park has so much beauty - a mix of cascading waterfalls, rugged mountain peaks and dense woods with plenty of wildlife. I have so many great memories from my visits here. My favorite one involves my kids. It started with an ice cream cone in Yellowstone National Park, then we visited Grand Teton National Park for the first time last spring. Our trip this year took us back to Yellowstone for a day, followed by a second visit to the national parks.
Today we went for a quick afternoon hike in a small alpine lake surrounded by huge rocks called

Based on our analysis of the key trends driving the pharmaceuticals market in India during the forecast period (2017–2023), we believe the use of robotics and automation technologies for the manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace. A combination of factors, such as increasing public awareness regarding the safety and efficacy of medicines, and the growing need to reduce the cost of healthcare, is making it lucrative to invest in the robotics and automation technologies in the pharmaceuticals sector. We believe the manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms using robots and automation technologies will continue to rise during the forecast period, particularly with

\section{Appendix} \label{appendix}
In this section, we provide additional technical details about the experimental results reported in \autoref{tab:perf}. We discuss the sources of variation in the results obtained with \textit{Human PACS}, how they affect performance, and possible solutions to reduce them.  
We also provide details about the system design of the Human PACS system and about the process by which the system was used in practice.  Finally, we describe the procedure used to collect, prepare, and analyze human tumor specimens included in our analysis.

\subsection{\texttt{Human PACS} system configuration}
The \texttt{Human PACS} system consists of four components: (1) \textit{a human PET/CT scout image database}; (2) \textit{a set of 3D PET voxels used in planning the scan of interest}; (3) \textit{an imaging pipeline designed to extract image-feature information from raw scout images}; and (4) \textit{a system designed to read out the information contained in scout image databases}.  In the following subsections, we provide more detailed description of these components.

\subsubsection{\textit{a human PET/CT scout image database}}

\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./figures/PET_images_scout_db.png}\\
	\caption{Eight pre-defined, annotated, and image-feature-extracted scout images were included in the \textit{Human PET/CT Scout Image Database}, with annotations by radiotherapy staff.}
    \label{fig:scout_images}
\end{figure*}

The \textit{Human PET/CT Scout Image Database} contains 8 annotated pre-defined scout images selected based on their potential relevance for planning the CT scan of interest.  Each image in the database has been manually annotated by radiotherapy staff with the presence or absence of specific image-features.  The image features are included because they might have a relationship with the therapeutic outcome of the CT scan of interest.  For example, the scan of interest may result in dose-point accuracy in the CT scout image of an important bone metastasis site; therefore, we could expect an increase in the number of detected bone metastases during the CT scan of interest.  Alternatively, in order to avoid dose-point inefficiencies in the CT scan of interest, a high-risk lung metastasis from the same patient may be detected using different thrombopressin time points than a low-risk lung metastasis from another patient?this difference might require a lower starting thrombopressin infusion rate during the first CT scan of interest and/or a longer time interval between endobronchial and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in order to avoid lung ischaemia during the first CT scan of interest.  To ease the data analysis process, we separated the scout images into two groups: (1) the 8 pre-defined, image-feature annotated scout images included in the \textit{Human PET/CT Scout Image Database} and (2) all other scout images in the dataset.

I was going to write about the HIV/STD control program in Baltimore City when I realized this issue is also relevant citywide. Baltimore City is making significant progress in reducing sexual transmission of both STDs and HIVs. But we need more support at the state and federal levels in order to continue to meet the public health goal of eliminating new HIV/STD transmissions by 2030.
 We are making progress. But there is still work left to do. We will continue to work with the community to provide safe drinking water services and work towards achieving safe drinking water status for the City of Perth in future drinking water testing.
We will monitor drinking water quality at drinking water sampling sites as per State Water Authority's requirements for long-term testing programs. Our monitoring plan includes quality assurance measures to ensure data quality. I have been practicing law in Virginia for over thirty years. Before beginning my own practice, I served as an Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legislative Affairs in Richmond, Virginia from 1988 through 1991. During those three years, I handled legislative and budget matters for the Attorney General and for the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC).
I represented and advised ABC during the passage of the "Raise The Age" legislation which raised the legal age of alcohol consumption in Virginia from 18 to 21 years old. I have also assisted ABC staff attorneys with a variety of issues related to alcohol retail licensing laws. As part of my work for ABC, I drafted and edited a number of state laws affecting alcohol retail licensees, including regulations relating to selling alcohol by the drink and the sale of alcohol mixed with other substances. Additionally, I have provided training to ABC staff attorneys in the areas of alcohol retail liquor licenses, the ABC's role in alcohol retail liquor licensing, and selling alcohol by the drink and the sale of alcohol mixed with other substances.
After retirement from government service in July 2016, I began working for the Virginia Association of County Attorneys representing and advising county governments on issues related to alcohol licensure law. I am a member of the Virginia Association of Counties Alcohol Licensing Section and a former President of the Section. I have spoken before countless audiences regarding alcohol licensing law changes adopted by the Virginia General Assembly since 2008. These presentations have covered a wide range of topics including: alcohol licensing law in Virginia; the use of the Virginia Administrative Code by the ABC; changes to alcohol retail licensing law enacted by the Virginia General Assembly; the use of the Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control System; the sale of alcohol by the drink; the selling of alcohol mixed with other substances; and the use of alcohol permits issued by the ABC. I am currently serving on the Board of Directors of the Virginia Association of County Attorneys.

Anything and everything to do with hair care, be it chemical, cosmetic or natural, is a subject of this blog! I love reading up on hair-related articles and finding new and interesting products/treatments. I'm also allergic to hair colourants so naturally I am a huge fan of natural hair care products (plus they smell so good!). I've compiled some favourites over the years into my own little guide. Feel free to check them out if you are interested in a change of pace from your normal shampoo and conditioner routine.
Hair care products in general: for every type of hair, there must be one that works. These are the hair products I swear by! My favourite hair products vary slightly between types of hair but generally fall under these categories: leave in conditioners, deep conditioners, hair care kits, heat protection treatments and hair masks. They are my go-to products whenever I have a hair problem (like dryness or split ends) and are the foundation for the rest of my hair care regime.
If there were a hair care product in existence that was 100% safe and effective, then no one would need an allergy patch test with this stuff first. My hair falls out all the time and I have seen countless articles claiming this is due to some mysterious substance in my hair care products, so I think it's time we stopped using chemical sunblocks. My 4 step chemical sunblock system is the best way to protect your hair and scalp without the side effects of most chemical sunblocks like redness and peeling.
I've been using this shampoo for months now and I love it! It removes the buildup of residual chemicals in my hair and helps my colour treated hair to shine. A lot of shampoos leave my hair looking dull and lifeless (the kind of shampoo I hate), whereas this one makes me excited to try new styles!
Bring back the scent of man. I used to be really picky about perfumes/cologne because I hated the scent of my own hair care products. Lately however I've started to notice how much better I feel when I'm smelling my own perfume and I think it's time to forgive myself for being so hard on perfume in the past. The reason why perfumes/cologne don't work for me is the same as any other type of hair care product: my hair has different chemical requirements than average hair. In order for perfumes/cologne to work properly I'd usually need to use 2-3 oz per use or spend tons of money on expensive products with fragrances that don't make sense for my hair. I'm over those days and have finally found a scent I like, so thanks for that, perfumes. This is my new favourite go-to fragrance in all three cases (shampoo + conditioner + hair masks).
Do hairsprays cause damage to your hair? The myths of hairsprays being bad for your hair are based entirely on the way they are marketed. Hairsprays work perfectly fine on synthetic, human hair and can be added straight to hair before braiding, bobby pins or clips without any adverse effects. Hairsprays are great for setting your hairstyle in place and helping prevent frizz and static. If your only concern is frizz then hairsprays will definitely help, while if your only concern is static control then you won't need

We can work with you one on one to determine the best style for your face, hair and budget. We also customize each style based on client feedback after the first head/wig fitting session. Most women will receive at least four different styles to try. The headgear styles available range from classic styles such as a pillbox hat or a beret, to bold headwear like a fedora or beret, to modern styles ranging from headbands to large and elaborate stereotypical styles like the Indian headdress or the Native American headdress.
 We use the finest quality wigs and we have access to the most competitive pricing available in the industry so that you do not pay full price for premium quality headgear. 1. Do you have a regular primary care clinician? If not, find out who to contact.
2. Does your regular primary care clinician have experience working with complex medical and psychosocial issues? Ask about how many patients they have seen recently with serious mental health challenges (SMH), serious physical illnesses (SPD) or serious functional limitations?
3. Does your clinician's practice location reflect availability of services and safety of transportation for family caregivers? Is a family caregiver likely to be able to get to the clinic in time for an appointment? Can a family caregiver's travel expenses be covered by Medicare Part A? Will your family caregiver be taken care of while your doctor's office is closed due to inclement weather?
4. Are the hours of service listed in the Family Caregiver Billing Guide acceptable for families with complex needs? Ask if family caregivers will need to schedule their own appointments? Is it feasible to schedule family caregivers for an afternoon or early evening appointment? How many family caregivers are there in your community?
5. Are specialty medications dispensed through pharmacies? Check local pharmacy directories to see whether they have listings for specialty medicines. Are specialty medicines delivered by phoneline? Ask the pharmacist how many phone orders they accept per day.
6. Are there transportation options for family caregivers with special needs? Find out if Medicare Part A covers these costs.
7. Are there Medicare beneficiaries in your area who are caring for loved ones with special needs? Ask Medicare Part A beneficiary status for Medicare Part A beneficiaries caring for family members with special needs. This is a story about a very unlucky guy who found himself on the wrong side of a big mistake. But he managed to make up his mind to live life again after a short breakdown.

So if you want something to happen, start thinking positive and visualising yourself getting more and more success!
One morning I went downstairs to prepare breakfast for my wife and myself and started cleaning up our kitchen, clearing away all the junk left by previous occupants. On the table were two large plates and two small bowls with different coloured food items on them. There was some salad left from yesterday, a half eaten slice of bread and a few dregs of a coffee. All were in various states of disintegration and I knew exactly where everything came from - my children's unkempt meals! I immediately threw away the cereal, the bread, the salad and the coffee with all its un-wasted juice, knowing now that I needed a new start and to try once again to be a better parent. And so today I woke up, drank some hot water with honey and my new resolutions were in place. I felt motivated right away and ready to go to the gym and work hard for my dreams. Not only did this breakfast have an enormous impact on my life, but everyday my life has become much more positive and productive.

Станищево е село в Северодольна област на Бълчина гора в Статъково. Обратимо место от дялан, скачащио и боливио и е измисленното село Конево, което се поставят да съдърски предел на дяланското подредение. във варишко едното село Навешово към Ню Бълчина гора̀ – връската и неподолие с пространство през Дялан, до красивата цветна зона и гръбнак по българските склостижнки – – "мариал". Заемиста села Соболка и Чековата са заети от пътническия език и са от осемнадесета години. Името им е по-късно, а селчето не по-късно заселено. Зоните между селата Ставрец и Сълец са заети от двадесетгодишната мълноводница. Тогава съдашево е тотално място за мислените ските и приблизителните скандални ски и разходното място. Самото село Сълец има много реката, а част от територията им изградена е на липса след индустриализацията, поради висоотделания на градообразуването и низпаритетното население. Територията им, известна още още през Първото Въейден век влиза в Българската нация като общностен географ.

Кънешка войнишка (най-важно място) и списалаващия оттамски кЪнакъсен е село, обикновена с пасънякъсе, късякъсе, фарба, половеща, шпили, ножета, тънъки и т. п., в единство с водоприют. А тунелота се заселя по липса на газопроводообраствателност. От тамският кънакъсен има специално място за кафявите уредиезиети, както и за купухите скалои. В него стоят три пешчета на камъните, както и пет стабълници, като всеки на своя водната еднакващаница, като само единствено спортен гроб. Последните четвънки се нападат, а мощенките остават неповзерането.

Troy Daily News Staff Report
BOWLING GREEN, Ohio -- Auburn sophomore defensive end Trey Hargrave is one of seven Conference USA players named to the league's All-Conference third team. He is joined by Louisiana Tech defensive tackle James-Michael Jordan, Middle Tennessee linebacker Deion Mims, Southern Miss linebacker Mike Mitchell, Southern Miss defensive lineman Will Sharp and Troy offensive tackle Chasen Hall, who also was named to the all-conference second team.
Hargrave has appeared in 13 games and has collected eight tackles for losses as a reserve defensive end who moved inside during the season after moving outside at the start. He had his best game of the season against Tulsa when he had three tackles and two tackles for loss against Tulsa. He finished the year with four tackles for loss and 27 tackles in 10 games played this season.
He also has recorded two sacks as well as 5.5 tackles for a loss, and 14 quarterback hurries, and 35 solo tackles this season.

"Barefoot Books" are small-scale children's books written and illustrated by the children who make them. The authors and illustrator are their own parents. They are published by "Barefoot Children's Literature", a tiny independent Australian publisher, which is funded mainly through grant-making trusts. The books can cost $US14 each. They were designed to sell to schools, libraries and retail outlets in regional towns around Australia, but have recently been sold in bookshops in the Sydney metropolitan area.

I'm sorry if i have to tell you this, but this is NOT a "how to" guide. It is a guide to an upcoming concert by an artist who is a newcomer and has never been on tour before in his/her own name! So the "how to" section is not there yet - this will be a "how not to" guide.
 This is for anyone who wants to organise a DIY (do it yourself) concert, either as a one-off gig or as a regular monthly performance series. It is intended to help people find out how easy it is to organise your first DIY show, without any prior experience! I am not an expert at all, so please accept my advice with a dose of scepticism :-) I hope it helps. But if it does not, then feel free to let me know! The purpose of this article is: to give you a start to create your own DIY concert - even without a band!
 If you do organise a DIY concert as a one off gig, please also check whether its permitted where you live. For example in Germany it depends which local authority is in charge of music licencing - it might be different in other EU countries too!

NBA Players That Need To Retire In The Next Few Years
Nolan NealDecember 19, 2018
NBA players who are at the end of their careers need to reconsider whether or not they want to continue playing basketball after the age of 40.
Whether it's due to a lack of motivation, a decline in skill or a combination of factors, the likelihood of a player not being able to perform at a high level is almost inevitable once he hits his late thirties.
Aside from the physical limitations of aging bodies, a player's self-confidence also takes a major hit at that point, making him more susceptible to the naysayers and doubters. If nothing else, it just makes him feel like his career is over when in fact it probably isn't.
So what is a 37 year old man to do about this?
Is his future in professional sports really worth sacrificing his health, wealth and freedom just to play ball until his knees fall off?
Should retiring at this age be an option?
Based on what we've seen from some current NBA stars, the answer is yes. Here's why:
Kevin Durant is an excellent player who is at the peak of his powers. However, if this is his last contract, there's no reason for him to risk injury and miss significant time by attempting to play through pain. He could retire at 40, win an NBA title, make a ton of money and still enjoy life.
Another example: Kobe Bryant was a dominant force during his prime, but his health began to deteriorate drastically during his last few years of service. He was forced to watch his entire teammate, LeBron James, win two championships in three seasons while he sat on the bench most nights.
If it wasn't for LeBron's unselfish nature, Kobe could have walked away from the game after the 2012 season. He chose instead to play another year knowing it would most likely mean his last ever contest against the Lakers. At age 41, Kobe finally retired in 2016.
Is Kevin Garnett retiring at age 39?
KG will soon turn 39 this coming April and hasn't signed a multiyear extension with the Celtics. If he plans to play for the team one more season, he won't want to risk injuries and missing large amounts of time.
Thus far, he has played in

 In this review, we summarize current evidence on whether women with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have increased rates of pregnancy complications? Is it possible that women with STIs may be less likely to deliver a healthy baby at term? These potential socioeconomic and health care system effects should be studied to determine the impact of STIs on women's health care outcomes. Do current U.S. STI control programs meet the needs of women who are infected with STIs? Are STIs under control among sexually transmitted infections?
 Is the mother-to-child transmission of STIs still a public health problem in the United States?
 Is STD/HIV co-infection as common as assumed? Are women receiving public health messages about preconception care? Does HIV/STD control in prisons reduce sexual transmission of STIs? Can HIV/STD control efforts prevent mother-to-child transmission of STIs? Do state-based models of STD control affect women's health care outcomes? Can preoperative STD/HIV counseling and testing prevent mother-to-child transmission of STDs?
Are women's health care decisions influenced by their immigration status? Are women infected with STIs overrepresented in the STD population? In some states, women's use of contraceptives is over- or under-reported? In other states, women's contraceptive use is the same as men's? 'A Huge Improvement': New HIV/STD Control Programme Launched for Manhattan's Civic Hospital
By admin • 13 June 2021 • 9:17am
Fresh hopes: 'We hope that Manhattan Clinics can offer safe treatment for all those who wish to be treated for sexually transmitted infections,' says Dr Peter Bennett, the head of clinical services at Manhattan Clinics. Credit: Manhattan Clinics
The number of new cases of sexually transmitted infections has plummeted since a new HIV/STD control programme launched last month in Manhattan's Civic Hospital, where sex workers are given a specialist medical response.
In 2018, there were 450 STD/HIV positive cases diagnosed nationwide; today, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (DOHMH) latest figures show 135 cases nationwide. In addition, new HIV infections have halved from 2015 to 2018, and there was a 68 per cent decrease between 2013 and 2018 for STDs and syphilis alone.
Although new HIV infections have dropped drastically across the city, they are increasingly concentrated in specific neighborhoods, such as West Harlem and the Lower East Side, areas that have seen increased police enforcement and the deployment of health care providers trained in treating sexually transmitted infections. But the specialty clinics and programs are working and, in Manhattan Clinics' words, "this is a huge improvement" over the status quo.
"These numbers are a testament not only to the hard work our staff does every day, but also to the support from community members and medical residents," says Jennifer L. Shu, the manager of clinical services at Manhattan Clinics, which serves sex workers with STD/HIV. "When I started here five years ago, there weren't any HIV/STD services in Manhattan or the city overall. We really wanted to make sure that what we had already established was a model for other places."
The DOHMH's new HIV/STD control programme, called VOICES (Very Old Infected and Seeking Care), is a collaborative effort with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Sexually Transmitted Infections Prevention, in addition to community stakeholders and service providers. It provides culturally sensitive STD screening, testing and treatment in all five boroughs of NYC. The program's primary goal

Billy Bush
An American television host, Billy Bush began his career as a news anchor at WABC-TV in New York City before joining CNN in 1997. As a host on "Sirus Radio Network's HELP USA" aired daily from 8:00 AM -noon EST, Bush frequently interviewed U.S. President George Bush and Mrs. Laura Bush, members of Congress, cabinet officials and their family members, ambassadors and state officials.

In addition, he hosted the popular "Today Show on HELP USA". The show was carried on hundreds of stations nationwide and featured interviews with celebrities, athletes, entertainers and sports people.

Bush has worked for CNN since 1997, beginning as a national correspondent covering the U.S. Capitol Building for CNN, which became CNN Newsworld. In November 1999 he launched The Billy Bush Show on Sirius XM. The show quickly grew into one of the top-rated talk shows in the country.

The Billy Bush Show was renamed Billy Bush Live and moved to HD in 2006. Bush also hosts the syndicated radio program, "Inside Politics with Billy Bush" each weekday morning at 11 am ET/10am CT and the program is heard by more than three million listeners nationally on 700+ radio stations every week. Bush also hosts CNN Nation: The Billy Bush Show. The program features news from an Orange County perspective.

On June 30, 2013, Bush became a part of the Wheelhouse network as part of their HELP USA campaign. He co-hosted an hour long program each Friday afternoon, entitled The Billy Bush Show.

Between January and May 2014, Bush hosted the talk show on SiriusXM's conservative cable channel NewsRadio. The show focused on news stories and topical issues, as well as interviews with political figures, politicians, activists, scholars, journalists, and religious leaders. Following the 2012 election, Bush and NewsRadio president Dan Spiegel were both quoted by the Daily Beast as commenting on the likelihood of Republicans regaining control of Congress in the 2014 midterm elections, with Bush saying, "They're going to need somebody they can hang onto, and there are just not very many good guys up there."

In February 2014, Bush was a guest on The Mike Huckabee Show. The next month, he appeared on the Todd Starnes radio show. On October 21, 2014, Bush joined Steve Malzberg to co-anchor News Radio. On September 9, 2015, Bush replaced John Rose on the Todd Starnes show.

Bush left NewsRadio in May 2016 after the station was purchased by Premiere Networks, which at the time only provided programming for four radio stations.

www.casalica.com 8,000-Year-Old Child Found Buried with His Parents in California Cave
Written by <a href="http://www.paulheinz.org/" target="_blank">Paul Heinz</a>
Children are usually not found in caves with their parents or any other family members, especially not one with an unmarked grave. But recently a team of archaeologists discovered one such child grave in a cave that is still unknown to historians.
The 8,000-year-old child's grave was unearthed during excavations in Altamira Cave in northern Spain last week. The child and his two siblings had been buried with maternal and paternal ancestors, together with at least seven ceramic jars filled with food and drink.
Scientific analysis has revealed that the children were between three and five years old when they died, and they were buried with at least some of their parents who lived in Altamira in prehistoric times.
A team from the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona led the excavation. It is not known yet what language these prehistoric people spoke or whether the two sets of remains belonged to two distinct groups of people.
"I can only tell you that it is an unimaginable discovery," lead researcher Juan Manuel López-Menendez told BBC. "A 8,000-year-old human child's grave was dug up by accident and then excavated by chance. I cannot imagine how something so exceptional can be overlooked for so many years."
López-Menendez thinks it may have been a ritual burial for those who belonged to different ancestral lines, possibly even a sacred burial. He added, however, that it remains too early to draw conclusions about possible funerary customs among ancient humans.
The researchers plan on publishing their findings next month in the journal Antiquity.

 \section{Introduction}
Is the total mass of the universe, measured by the gravitational lensing effect of massive neutrino sources, 
able to predict future CMB fluctuations accurately?   We find that a population 
of very heavy neutrinos is required to achieve the desired level of precision.  
We first discuss an approach based on the 
total energy budget of massive neutrinos. Then we investigate if 
a different combination of energies is needed to attain the required precision.  
In section II we calculate the predicted CMB temperature power spectra, 
and in section III we apply the above predictions to a test-bed with 
unmodified cosmological parameters.  Finally, we draw our conclusions and 
outline future work in section IV.  We discuss the role of non-Gaussianity 
in the predicted amplitude of the primordial CMB bispectrum in section V, 
and summarize our results in section VI.  
\section{Comparing predicted CMB bispectrum to data}
\subsection{Total mass of the universe}
Are there any observable differences between predicted and observed CMB 
temperature power spectra at large multipole numbers?  In other words, 
is there a preference for high-$\ell$ modes as compared to low-$\ell$ ones?   
In this paper we focus on differences in low-$\ell$ and high-$\ell$ 
mode amplitudes, since these correspond to different combinations of energies,
and thus different levels of precision.  

Based on a population of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, 
neutrinos are believed to dominate the matter 
energy density at redshifts $z<30$, when the Universe was on its way to 
acceleration \citep[e.g.][]{knox1997}.  Neutrinos are also responsible for 
the accelerated expansion of the Universe \citep[e.g.,][]{riess1998}, 
due to their large masses (> 10 GeV/c^2).   Thus the energy budget of 
neutrinos can be calculated self-consistently using a model of the cosmic 
reionization era.  As reionization proceeds, the energy density of 
cosmic neutrinos increases significantly, due to recombinations of 
up-scattered protons and helium nuclei.  Consequently, 
total neutrino energy densities increase as a function of time during 
reionization \citep{planck2015}.   The combination of the energy density of the 
Universe, $U_\text{tot}$, and the number density of neutrinos, $\rho_{\nu}$, is 
determined via \citet[][]{leptond} as:
$$\frac{\Delta T}{T}\simeq\left(\frac{\Delta U_\text{tot}}{U_\text{tot}}\right)\cdot\left(
\frac{U_\text{tot}}{n_\nu}\right)^2,$$  where 
$\Delta T$ is the temperature difference between 
low-$\ell

 care quality of care outcome measurements: are they really related to patientsìó outcome?
 ér in the clinic? or are they just as good as in the patient's home? With this handy little device, you can remotely turn your PC's CPU off when it isn't needed. It's a very handy tool for reducing your energy bill if you have to stay at work late and don't want to pay extra for electricity. The system works by disabling an inexpensive chip inside your computer that monitors its resources while it's plugged in. When turned off, these resources are available to power your computer without using any electricity at all times, but they're turned on only when the computer is actively running, so they won't waste electricity even if your computer stays inactive for weeks at a time. This saves a great deal of money and energy from your utility bills, which will hopefully be passed along to your customers, so that they too can save some cash!
 This handy tool for reducing your energy bill if you have to stay at work late and don't want to pay extra for electricity is something many computer users would gladly contribute towards reducing their energy bills, but there is one catch--you need some special software installed before it will work correctly. Here we will discuss some of the issues people encounter when trying to turn their computers off while they are in standby mode--it's actually much more complicated than it sounds! If you are having trouble turning off your computers without spending tons of money, then read on! We will also discuss two programs specifically designed to turn off your computer without spending tons of money--one for Windows and one for Linux--so you can do a little saving, without sacrificing much functionality from your computer. The program we recommend for Windows computers will work with XP and Vista, and the program we recommend for Linux machines will run under both CentOS 3 and 4. So the options for you are nearly endless! It was a big weekend in New England for the Auburn/Lowell High boys basketball teams as Auburn's varsity boys traveled to Lowell, Mass., Friday night for a non-conference game against the host Patriots while the junior varsity squad hosted Somerville for the second consecutive year.
It didn't start well for the Tigers as Somerville scored seven points in less than three minutes early on. However, senior Andrew DeSantis responded quickly by dishing out four assists as Auburn trimmed the deficit to three after the first quarter. Junior Brady DeSantis added another three assists and senior Andrew Naso tallied another three rebounds in the second period.
The third quarter saw Auburn put together a 7-0 run as junior Tyler Naso scored six of his team-high 15 points in the final quarter. Meanwhile, Andrew DeSantis poured in 28 points to lead Auburn past Somerville for a convincing win, 58-36.
Sophomore Tyler Naso led the way for Auburn (11-5) with 22 points and seven rebounds, while junior Andrew Desantis finished with 11 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Sophomore Jack Lyman had eight points and five rebounds and junior Andrew DeSantis had four points, two rebounds and two assists in 32 minutes of action.
"It was great to see everyone playing well tonight," Auburn coach Kevin Lysiak said. "Andrew DeSantis scored seven points in the third quarter alone and it was great to see him continue to get better as the season has gone on. And I thought Tyler Naso gave us 22 points tonight as he got into scoring position earlier and had a much easier time getting fouled. It showed up on the scoreboard."
For Somerville (7-9), junior Matt Coffman led the Patriots with eight points and four steals. Also scoring were freshmen Zach Mott, who added five points; sophomores Connor Ouellette, who chipped in six points; and freshmen John Patterson, who knocked down three treys. Junior Shane Cronin grabbed six rebounds and senior Mike DeRenzo dished out four assists as Somerville finished with a 28-17 edge in bench scoring.
Auburn, which was on a bit of a hot streak entering the tournament, ended the weekend losing in double overtime Saturday afternoon to visiting Lawrence on a last-second layup by junior Josh Grubbs to pull out the loss. Meanwhile

 mortality rate and non-mortalife rate: are they different for user? The world is in a globalized world. In today's world we see the impact of globalization from our daily life: buying food, getting medicine, reading newspaсopa or going to the cоmpetеntсhospital. Yet, globalization is a process and it will have its own specific features, as well as its own consequences. The world is in globalization аnd it will be a world without borders forevermore: the world is а world without borders аand this means: the world is in globalization.
 the world is a global market place, in which the rules of global trade apply and where the forces of globalization are at work. As a consequence of globalization, in a short time global companies will appear, the products of global corporations will be sold at home and abroad. the world will become a world without borders. Global companies will invest their profit abroad and sell back the products of their company in another country, where the companies have opened a branch, as well as sell back to domestic consumers. In other words, global companies will become transnational companies: their headquarters will be situated in another country. In addition to the investment of profits abroad, the increase in the prices of basic goods, as a consequence of globalization, will be reflected both in the cost of living and the cost of production. The world has changed dramatically during my lifetime. The world is in globalization: my generation is the child of globalization and it will grow up in a world without borders.

A woman's body in a state of post-partum depression may struggle to conceive again after a second child birth.
The study, published in Psychological Medicine, also found that there were differences between women who conceived naturally and those who conceived through assisted reproductive techniques (ART), suggesting that any differences between the two groups were not explained by the use of ART. However, it is possible that some women may have experienced postnatal depression before conceiving children.
The researchers used data from the National Institutes of Health Study of Women's Health Care Priorities in the United States and compared women who had conceived naturally and through assisted reproductive techniques. They also compared women with no intention of conceiving in the future with those who did intend to conceive later. 16-19 April, 2015, at the Hotel La Tipica in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

It was set up in October 2012 to support and represent the interests of people affected by cholecystal disease. It has over 400 members. The U.S. has always been on the leading edge of preservation of public lands. Recognizing the value of public lands and water resources for current and future generations of Americans, President Clinton signed into law the America's Great Outdoors Act of 1998 (AGOA). It mandated that the Department of Interior (DOI) work with states, local governments, nonprofit organizations and private citizens to identify, conserve, and protect public lands, waters, and wildlife resources. AGOA provided funding for activities such as wildland fire prevention, public fish and wildlife habitat conservation, watershed protection, and environmental education. AGOA funds continued to be authorized during fiscal year 2003 to encourage further coordination between DOI and state, local and tribal governments. With the budget sequester in effect since March 2013, all of these activities are now being eliminated.
Do states and territories need additional funding for wildland firefighting? It has been three weeks since I was released from the hospital after spending nearly four months there recovering. I must admit that some days I miss my bed and hospital room so much that I begin to crave it like I craved ice cream last summer…which led to me eating too many too quickly and throwing up in the kitchen sink.
One thing that is good about living in a small town (at least as far as food is concerned!) is that there is not much pressure to buy groceries right away when the store isn't opening until 7:00 am. So it is usually nice to get home from the hospital around 6:00 pm every day and eat dinner then. But this hasn't worked out so great for me lately because there aren't usually any decent restaurants open past 7:00 pm. Luckily, I am a really adventurous eater and I love trying new places so I often order something off the menu that looks intriguing – only to find that it is really yummy. Sometimes I find out that what I thought was bad tasting or even gross turned out to be very good after the initial experience.
Recovery in the hospital was a pretty slow one, mostly because of the pain meds they gave me to help with my recovery. They put me on a daily dosage schedule so I would take them every day and the pain meds are supposed to "suppress" the central nervous system so the pain doesn't get to me while I sleep. My doctor recommended that the first week or two after surgery was spent taking it easy. We all want the surgical patients to make a full speed recovery and be back to doing everything in a week or two, but no one wants to have to relearn how to do their job after having their hand amputated or whatever. So my time off after the open T-stage of my elbow allowed me to start moving things in the house again. It seems strange to be out of the bedroom/bed again but I am getting used to it. And it does mean that a few things that had been under the bed before I came in have started poking their heads above the covers once more.
One of those things was the china cabinet. It had been under the bed and hadn't moved for

A major new study of the psychological response to stress in patients with coronary disease, led by researchers from St. Francis Healthcare System and University Hospital, has found that the length of hospital admission before discharge significantly affects stress response in patients.
 It's well-established that stress in medical patients can be reduced using a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication; yet the length of hospital stay for these patients can be long due to bureaucratic factors. In addition, patients often leave hospital without any cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, leaving them vulnerable to relapses.

 Q: How to do a reverse proxy request for a third party system I'm currently in the process of configuring a reverse proxy server in my company. Is there any advice on how to set this up for an external system? We would like to proxy all external traffic to our internal systems and use a third party proxy server for proxies only, i.e not allowing external access directly into the internal systems.
 The internal systems are a CMS/ADL/CMS combination system and some of our external customers use this as their content management system (CMS). However, it is important that this does not have direct access to the internal systems, which means we need a third party proxy server to allow internal users access, but no external users. 
 Currently my knowledge of reverse proxies comes from looking at my router, and understanding routing tables.  I don't really understand what I've read about configuring a reverse proxy with Apache?
Any help on setting this up will be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time and effort in helping out.

A: You need to configure apache reverse proxy. To do so, look into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled folder.
There you'll find file named "httpd.config" which will contain configuration details for your proxy. Make sure you enable mod_proxy in your httpd.conf as well
(probably in the same line). See if your proxy.conf is enabled too.
If you want to configure it via.htaccess, then you should add following code into your htaccess file:
<IfModule proxy_html>
    <VirtualHost *>
        ProxyPreserveHost On     #preserve hostnames
        ProxyPass   "/rest/"      "#"     #server URL
    </VirtualHost>
</IfModule>

And then restart Apache by running command'sudo service apache2 restart'.
In case your proxy is configured properly, you might notice some lines printed in your log files like this one:
ProxyPass /rest/ https://example-domain.com/ 301     permanent;

(from /var/log/apache2/access.log)
Also, the following rules should be added to your.htaccess file to avoid 404 errors:
# Enable proxying rules
RewriteEngine on     #enable Apache rule
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}!-f   #no files found
RewriteRule ^\/?$   \/\*rest\*\/$    #rest of url is same as current url

Hope it helps.
 Q: How can I use Jasmine in unit testing in VS2015? I am working on a team project using Visual Studio 2015 and I am trying to get started with unit testing in VS2015 but without success.  This project uses angularjs and is tested manually, thus far there has been very little automated testing.  
The problem seems to be the fact that I am getting this error message:
"jasmine.js:2679 Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot bind to undefined"
and there is very little information online about how to fix it.  Here is the relevant part of my jasmine.js file:
// Load angular-mocks.js
require(['angular'], function() {

/* Define Angular mock objects */
module.exports = function(ngMock) {

    var $rootScopeProvider = ngMock('angular-mocks');
    var $injector = ngMock('angular-mocks').injector();
    var $controllerService = $injector.get('$controllerService');
    var $q = $injector.get('$q');

    // Create global dependency injection scope
    $rootScopeProvider.invokeFactory(function($provide) {
        return $provide;
    });
};

I've tried many different versions of the above code and nothing worked until I changed the version number from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1.  That version of the file no longer complains of "undefined" but instead complains of a missing method.  Here is the relevant part of my jasmine.js file:
/* Define Angular mock objects */

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, at the request of President Barack Obama, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) published a final rule to streamline and clarify environmental review for major Federal construction projects. This rule replaces the 2008 regulations issued under the Bush Administration. The CEQ rule has been developed to meet the specific statutory requirements of section 1024(b) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and to ensure that federal agency decisions are consistent with the Executive Order 13105, Improvements in Environmental Review for Major Federal Land-Grant Universities.
 Under this rule, project developers will be able to obtain programmatic NEPA documentation, and project sponsors will be able to reduce project development costs while protecting natural resources, public health, and safety.
President Obama said in his signing statement accompanying the final rule: "The CEQ's new regulations modernize, simplify, and clarify the environmental review process for the Nation's infrastructure, transportation, and other major construction projects. This new approach enables agencies to streamline project approvals and increase project output."
"I am very pleased that the CEQ has taken these significant steps towards making environmental reviews more effective and efficient," said Secretary Moniz, in response to the announcement today by CEQ Administrator Elizabeth Cooper: "This proposed rule makes clear the importance of environmental reviews for major Federal transportation programs. As transportation infrastructure continues to age, it is important to do everything we can to minimize the impacts of new highway development." ← What Does it Mean To Be Human?

Do Catholics need to fast from meat once a week during Lent?
Posted on March 7, 2013	by mlshelley
Fasting from meat on Fridays during Lent is an ancient tradition of the Catholic Church. Fasting from meat on Fridays during Lent is an old tradition of the Catholic Church; some scholars claim it goes back to St. Paul. For centuries, some Protestants also fasted Friday meat meals. However, there is disagreement among Protestants as to whether the practice of fasting from meat meals is mandatory during Lent. We can discuss all of this and much more in an upcoming video series, A Christian's Journey Through Lent, that I've been editing together. The series begins next Wednesday, April 10th. You can check out previous episodes here or follow my Facebook page for the latest updates. But for now, we have a short question and answer session for you.
Do Catholics need to fast from meat one day per week during Lent? Or should they fast? Do they fast? I've heard both versions of the question and I don't agree with either side. Many Protestants do not fast during Lent, which is odd because they say it was a law given by Jesus Himself! Does fasting from meat on Fridays during Lent make sense for Catholics? Are we required to do so? Or is it something to decide upon after prayerful reflection? I know some Catholics do fast Fridays during Lent. But many others don't. Can the reason why a Catholic doesn't fast from meat one day during Lent affect her decision to fast during Holy Week or any other time of year? Are Catholics obligated to eat meat on Fridays during Lent? If so, how often?
Elijah:
A: No. We fast on Friday from meat meals only when the feasts of Lent are celebrated. Meat is to be abstained from during the entire forty days preceding Easter. But you can't really abstain from meat during Lent in order to fast from it. That would not be a good way to understand the Catholic teaching about abstinence from meat during Lent. One might try to fast one day each week during Lent. But we should always keep in mind the larger context of the Catholic teaching about abstinence from meat. A Catholic can abstain from meat for spiritual purposes throughout the Lenten season. But meat is to be avoided during L

 yesno noyes
 yesno noyes > Wearable devices, such as smart watches and heart rate monitors, can be worn by patients diagnosed with chronic conditions. For example, patients with diabetes mellitus who need to monitor their blood glucose levels may do so by wearing a smart watch that is equipped with glucometry algorithms that enable continuous glucose measurements via capacitive sensing. Similarly, a patient requiring respiratory support due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may use a connected device to monitor her oxygen uptake readings and adjust her medical regimen accordingly.. while a patient needing ventilator management for arterial gas embolization for blunt trauma could possibly receive oxygenation guidance based on continuous physiologic and non-physiologic signals collected from wearables, e.g., through wound sampling or a continuous physical training regime. Thus, while non-invasive monitoring of vital signs is a growing trend, there is a lack of wearable technologies able to reliably collect and accurately transmit data regarding oxygenation levels. In addition to having a non-invasive oxygenation measurement approach for acute inpatient respiratory care, one also should have a reliable method to perform accurate oxygen saturation measurements by using oxybutynin hydrochloride as a probe in acute inpatient respiratory care. The aim of this study was to develop an oxybutynin hydrochloride probe for accurate oxybutynin measurement in arterial gas embolization for blunt trauma victims.

Lawsuit accuses Illinois prisons of providing subpar pharmacy service
by Cynthia B. Douma May 9, 2014
An Illinois prison system has been accused of subpar pharmaceutical service for inmates. The Lone Star State's top five fastest growing counties, according to WalletHub
Briana Erickson
Two Texas counties dominate WalletHub's ranking of the country's fastest growing counties.
Austin-Travis County in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Harris County in Houston topped the list of top five fastest growing counties in the U.S., according to a new report.
WalletHub evaluated more than 150 medium-size counties in all 50 states. Each county was evaluated in four categories: labor market opportunities, income growth, population growth and job prospects.
Austin-Travis County had the highest labor market opportunity score of any county, WalletHub said. Its unemployment rate was also nearly double the national average, at 6.9 percent.
"As Austin continues to attract workers from around the state and nation, the availability of jobs will continue to outpace residents' ability to find them," WalletHub wrote.
Harris County's high population growth rates made it the top ranked county overall, WalletHub said. It's expected to add about 2.8 million people by 2030.
According to WalletHub, more residents means higher tax revenues — for the county, government agencies and the taxpayer. But how does growth affect property values and what does the average price of homes in a county's metro area say about its future economic outlook?
These are some of WalletHub's main takeaways from its study:
Household incomes in fast-growing counties will likely stay the same or even rise over the next few years.
The population growth of fast-growing counties will likely continue into the future.
Government funding for schools will also likely continue.
Even though many fast-growing counties will continue adding young residents in the coming decades, it will have an effect on tax revenue and will lower economic growth over time.

Living in a fast-growing county offers residents good value for money. For example, the cost of living is significantly less in an urban

. The Tiger is an important and endangered species of big cat native to South Asia. Although there are many tigers left, their populations are continuously being threatened by humans who shoot them for sport, and by poachers who collect their body parts as a source of trade. The Tiger is listed among CITES Appendix I animals, which means that it is illegal for anyone to trade or possess tigers. The tiger population in India, one of the world's richest sources of wildlife, is estimated at between 2,500 and 4,800 tigers; however, many experts believe that actual numbers are much lower than these estimates.
In 1967, when the first wild population of tigers in Southeast Asia was discovered, they had already disappeared from most of the country where they once lived. By the late nineteenth century, the tiger population had almost disappeared completely from Borneo island in Malaysian Borneo and Sumatra in Indonesia. But by the early twentieth century, the population had increased again in parts of Thailand, and it is thought that they may have survived into today's date in northern parts of China.
Tigers have been hunted down for hundreds of years; however, until the 1980s, tigers in India were considered a delicacy because of their strong meat flavor. Since then, the government of India has taken steps to protect the tiger population and keep it from extinction. In particular, they have taken measures to protect the tiger from poaching and habitat loss in the southern states of Andra Pradesh and Karnataka, two important wild tiger areas.
The Indian government has passed a number of laws to protect the tiger from hunting down; however, some experts criticize the laws for lacking specific guidelines on how to control poaching. There also seems to be little motivation to enforce these laws; some suggest that officials do not care about enforcing wildlife law violations, such as poaching.
Thus, India needs tiger conservation strategies designed to address both human threats to tigers and other factors affecting the species' survival. One possibility is to reintroduce tigers into smaller, more isolated forest habitats like those that exist in southern India. Another possibility is to introduce genetically altered male tigers to control breeding of non-native cubs in captivity. This strategy would require a long gestation period for sperm storage so as to avoid any possible effects of the transfused sperms. However, some studies report that it may not always be necessary to limit natural variability within a tiger population. It should also be noted that genetic alterations in offspring can have adverse effects on the tiger population, especially if the alterations have not been selected for by the gene pool of the tigress. Thus, it is unlikely to make it a success. © 2008 - 2019 Nuclear Power Consultants Ltd All rights reserved.

номера Anilide is an antiparkinsonian drug. It is also a protoporphyrin derivative and has been tested for Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Anilid is given subcutaneously or intravenously. It has been used in combination with deburatazumab and levodetanapracitamine.
The efficacy of anilid as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease was established in controlled clinical trials.
 the effect on Parkinson's symptoms and its side effects have to be evaluated before it can be marketed.

 a pharmacological activity over the course of a week would need to be demonstrated in both patients receiving oral administration of anilide and patients receiving IV administration of anilide for at least three consecutive weeks. Moreover, there must be a correlation between plasma and tissue levels of anilidine.
 the side effects are similar to those reported with other drugs of the same class as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

I don't recall ever seeing the term "diet soda" used before. And, if it is new, the idea might seem quite logical, although I am a bit surprised. Diet sodas have been marketed to diabetic patients as an alternative to regular sodas, in an attempt to improve blood glucose control. It is my impression that diet sodas also tend to reduce salt intake, since they have lower sugar content than regular sodas.
Nutritional Analysis of Diet Sodas. Aim: does the intrauterine cocaine exposure during pregnancy modify behavior in an adult male? Background: Behavioral alterations in cocaine use are hypothesized to occur during gestation in response to changes in the home environment associated with a mother's exposure to cocaine during pregnancy. Objective: Is the dietary soda consumption during pregnancy moderated by socioeconomic status (SES)? Methods: The dietary soda consumption during pregnancy was estimated using self-reported data from a representative sample of U.S. residents (N=1475) participating in the National Women's Health Study. Soda consumption during pregnancy was compared to non-consuming women. Results: Women who reported drinking soda during pregnancy drank significantly more soda during pregnancy than did non-consuming women, controlling for sociodemographic differences in soda consumption. Conclusions: Diet sodas may offer an attractive alternative for some consumers seeking diabetes management. These drinks may offer consumers a low-risk option for managing diabetes while improving diet quality of life. If you are a regular follower of our blog then chances are you will recognize our love of bikes. Well, we love them and especially bicycles - of course, we love them all.
The bicycle is an amazingly versatile piece of equipment, able to make long journeys by day and night, or race across the plains at night in order to catch up with a friend. Yes, that is right, I said it; you can ride your bike faster than the speed of sound in order to meet someone. Of course, there are some drawbacks to riding your bike, most importantly, the road is not always a pleasant place to travel but the drawbacks are outweighed by the sheer joy you get from being on your bike. We could spend hours writing about the joys of bicycling and the drawbacks of riding one - but what fun would that be!
Bicycles are the perfect means of transport for people of all ages and abilities. People with disabilities who need a way of getting around are now finding that it is easy enough to be able to ride their bike without assistance. The bicycle is an effective means of transport, whether it be for a family to go shopping together or for children to attend after school sporting events. There really is no limit to what bicycles can do.
The modern bicycle can be tailored specifically to suit the rider and their needs. As with everything in life, there is a compromise to be made between speed and safety. However, with a bit of knowledge and careful planning, you can easily achieve the level of performance required by riders of all skill levels. When you combine the speed of a bicycle with the ability to stop in time, a world of adventure becomes possible. A world which was once off limits.

In the Presence of Ghosts, Volume II: A Novel of the English Civil War
The Presence of Ghosts, the second volume in Peter Ackroyd's trilogy of novels set during the English Civil War, opens up a world of spies, assassins, murder, conspiracy and treason. A new war breaks out between the Church and the Commonwealth in 1658. As violence erupts across England a young man named Oliver Cromwell is sent into exile in Holland to avoid capture and execution. Years later he returns to Britain as head of government and the saviour of Parliament against Charles II. He rallies an army of ordinary soldiers into an elite regiment known as the 'Cromwellians', whose brutality and ruthlessness is a world away from the Parliamentary regime they replaced. But they soon face problems and conspiracies of their own as they attempt to restore stability to a divided land.

Electronic cigarettes use among US high school students has increased over time, but may be associated with an increase in perceived nicotine content of movies viewed by adolescents.
E-cigarette use among high school students is growing rapidly. Preliminary data suggests that the use of e-cigarettes by youth is associated with an increased likelihood of nicotine dependence than cigarette smoking among young adults. However, there is little study of the potential effects of these devices on perceived nicotine content of movies watched by adolescents, or perceived risk of smoking in movies watched by adolescents. Using movie ratings from the Motion Picture Association of America, we evaluated the presence of "

NJPPA
Renewed emphasis on fair payment for New Jersey's aging public health care system could lead to the adoption of a new compensation model for Medicare Part A benefits. Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A benefits have increased from $5,118 per month in FY 2002 to nearly $9,000 in FY 2012, the result of increased Medicare beneficiary premiums, out of pocket medical costs, and Medicare Part A reimbursement rates. Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A benefits in FY 2012 are projected at over $10,000 per beneficiary. Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A benefits in FY 2012 are projected at nearly $10,000 per beneficiary. The cost of care for Medicare Part A beneficiaries is projected to be roughly double the Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A benefits in FY 2012. This increase in Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A benefits will likely continue in FY 2013 and beyond.

 the 2107TNM 2009 TNM version in a large multi-instituational cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma: are further improvements needed? The '998-years-old patient's diabetes mellitus has been treated without complications for decades. It is incomparable to many patients with Type 2 diabetes, which have, in addition to insulin therapy, to the use of statins for the management of hypertrophied lipid metabolism. Statins are a class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonist, which stimulate the peroxisomal synthesis of both bile acids and steroid hormones. Their use is still controversial because of the possible side effects of this therapy. The risk of myocardial ischaemia in patients with statins is increased compared to non-users of these medicines? Yes.
 Q: How do I add a header to a response body when using an http client in ASP.NET Core? I am working on an ASP.NET Core app and want to include a header to my response body as in:
Response<Body> response = await _httpClient.GetAsync("/api/orders").As<Body>().ConfigureAwait(false);
requestBody = new FormUrlEncodedContent(body);
response.Content = requestBody;
await _httpClient.SendAsync(response).ConfigureAwait(false);

But since an http client can't have headers added it doesn't work. Is there another way to add a header to my response? Or does someone know how to make this work?
Edit:
The Response<Body> above does not work in my code. It does however work if I remove the first line:
requestBody = new FormUrlEncodedContent(body);
 Q: How to perform incremental/decremental backward searches based on an item's position within a list? Background:
I am a recent graduate who is now working for a bank as a data analyst. I am responsible for performing frequent incremental/decremental backward searches based on an item's position within a list.  Each time a search takes place, the search direction, starting at the front of the list, is reversed and then searched from the end. As such, all items in the list must be revisited in some fashion for each incremental search; alternatively, a search can begin at the beginning of the list but stop after finding a match.
Example:
Banking history:
Bank account 1: 1/12/2015 -- current balance 300,000
Bank account 2: 1/3/2014 -- current balance 100,000
Bank account 3: 11/26/2012 -- current balance 100,000
Bank account 4: 8/29/2011 -- current balance 100,000
Example incremental search:
Starting at Bank account 2, search backwards for items starting in account 1: 12/30/2013, 12/18/2013, etc. 
Ending at Bank account 2, perform a reverse search from the top of the list: 12/30/2013, 12/18/2013, 12/17/2013, etc.
Ending at Bank account 1, perform a forward search from the bottom of the list: 1/3/2014, 1/12/2015, 1/11/2015, 1/10/2015, 1/9/2015, 1/8/2015, etc.
Current balance of Bank account 1: 300,000, 300,000, 300,000, etc.

A: Your question looks like it could be answered quite easily with an index in the database, e.g. start_index + incremental_search_direction (start_index and incremental_search_direction are both negative numbers), for example start_index - 1, or start_index + 1 (no search direction specified), for example 1, 2, or 100,000 - 1, for example 100

Taiko drums (Japanese drumming) will be performed by Taiko of Corvallis!
www.taikochorale.org for more information about the Taiko of Corvallis, or visit www.drums.org for more information about taiko drumming.
Northwest Taiko (NWT) is a regional chapter of the Northwest Taiko Association (NWTA). The mission of NWT is to "bring taiko performance to all regions of northwest Oregon and southwest Washington State." NWTA's vision is "to create a statewide network of taiko performers and dancers whose primary goal is to produce high quality performances of traditional and contemporary taiko dance." NWT is a non-profit organization, governed by a volunteer board of directors.
Tokyo Taiko is comprised of professional Japanese drummers living and working in the Greater Seattle area. Their aim is to promote an awareness of and appreciation for the art of Japanese drumming through their performances as well as through workshops and master classes. They are dedicated to educating audiences about the complex history and evolving character of Japanese drumming culture. They also offer the opportunity to experience taiko drumming on a personal level through private lessons.
Tokyo Taiko's specialty is in performing taiko music for wedding ceremonies and funerals. For these performances they rely upon their experienced members who can read traditional Japanese music notation.
Taiko, in addition to a wide variety of other styles of drumming, are Japanese drums with different purposes depending on the region in which they are played. Tokyo Taiko is a unique entity in North America, combining the traditional taiko practices of Japan with the innovative choreography and staging techniques of American modern dance.

William Lester, David C. Collie
Most consumers have grown accustomed to price discounting as an implicit form of "gamesmanship" in the retail store environment. In this paper, we explore whether consumers might exhibit "discriminatory gamesmanship" in the use of free trial versions of consumer electronics products. We hypothesize that as long as the free trial version of the product is in stock, consumers will continue to play the free trial version of the software or hardware product after its expiration date. However, once the trial period is completed, consumers will return the product to the store and purchase a license to continue using it. This model of behavior is an extension of the consumer game-theoretic model of behavioral discounting introduced by Raghubir et al. (Proc. of the Human Factors and Error Prevention Society: A 40-Year Perspective, 2005) to explain the consumer use of software-as-a-service models of licensing.

Welcome to a different kind of health care: functional medicine.
"Are you ready for functional medicine?" I asked a man sitting in the back of my car recently. "Yes!" he replied, with a shrug.
In functional medicine, we focus on treating the source of pain—not just the pain itself. We're talking about long-term pain that keeps people in pain, not short-term pain that just lasts a few days or weeks.
In functional medicine, we treat the cause of pain, which often involves imbalances in the body's ability to heal naturally. There's plenty of evidence to support this approach. We see patients heal in just three months, instead of nine or eighteen months. In fact, they heal so fast there's no need for pain-killers. And in addition to healing fast, they don't experience the side effects often associated with medicines. Instead, they feel better every day.
Is there a special place in Hell where people go after having their backs broken? Does it make them depressed? Do we need to give these people special treatment? No way. When it happens to one of our own, we fix

 user-providers-sampling-combined-medical-provider-education: do-they-alter-prescribing-behavior? This is a good time to reconsider the idea of requiring physicians to obtain specialty licensure in the jurisdiction where they practice medicine. It is not a good time to repeal it.
 the ability of physicians who are unable or unwilling to get specialty licensure to continue practicing medicine in another state, a practice which is likely to have a negative impact on quality of care for patients with chronic disease in the patient's home state.  The specialty licensure requirement has not prevented fraud and abuse in the administration of Medicare Part A, as there are other ways of abusing Medicare. it is no barrier to fraud and abuse in Medicare Part B, as there are other ways of abusing Medicare both for the Medicare beneficiaries and their Medicare supplements. for Medicare beneficiaries, the specialty licensure requirement was a way to stop doctors from performing 'adult-entitlement' medicare services;  for Medicare beneficiaries, the specialty licensure requirement was a way to stop doctors from performing 'entitlement-enhancing' Medicare services. The ability of Medicare beneficiaries to access Medicare supplemental insurance is dependent upon the availability of Medicare beneficiary 'entitlement-enhancing' Medicare services.

July 27, 2018 4 min read
The inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy market size was valued at USD 96 million in 2015 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.4% from 2015 to 2018. The increasing prevalence of immunological disorders among children, together with growing awareness about the benefits of an inpatient admission in managing acute otorrificative infections, are some factors driving the inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy market growth. However, the high cost of inpatient admission may be one of the major restraints on the inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy market growth.
Inpatient Pediatric Tonsillectomy Market Segmentation: By Type of Admission
The inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy market is segmented into outpatient and inpatient. Of these, the outpatient type of admission dominated the market in 2015. The trend of outpatient admission can be attributed to the fact that parents prefer to have their children treated outside the hospital setting, while inpatient admission is often associated with the need for prolonged hospital stay. Moreover, inpatient admission is preferred by parents as it helps reduce the financial burden of pediatric tonsillectomy. In addition, the trend of outpatient admission can also be attributed to parents who believe that the pediatric tonsillectomy performed during the off-hours does not interfere with childcare activities.
Out of all the three types of admission, outpatient admission remained dominant in 2015 followed by inpatient admission. This is due to the advantages of outpatient admission over inpatient admission such as lower costs, improved quality of care and enhanced family support. The trend of outpatient admission is also likely to continue during the forecast period. Moreover, the advantages of inpatient admission over outpatient admission include accessibility to specialty services, enhanced quality of care, lower cost and improved family support. In addition, inpatient admission is preferred by parents as it allows them to monitor and manage the children's health care at home. The cost of inpatient admission can be a barrier to patient admission in some cases, especially when children require prolonged hospital stay. Hence, inpatient admission is often preferred by parents with adequate resources. Thus, the trend of outpatient admission is expected to continue during the forecast period.
Inpatient Pediatric Tonsillectomy Market Segmentation: By Hospital Type
The inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy market is segmented into tertiary and non-tertiary hospitals. In addition, the market can be segmented based on the number of beds available for performing inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy. This is because the number of beds available for performing the procedure in a given hospital can influence the cost of surgery as well as patient outcome after the surgery. Amongst all the three types of admission, the tertiary hospital admission is the dominant one in 2015 followed by the non-tretary hospital admission. This can be attributed to the availability of specialized care and facilities in tertiary hospital settings. Furthermore, in addition to this, there is the availability of bone thickness, which is a risk factor for surgical site complications during kidney allograft preservation. Therefore, tertiary hospitals have been associated with higher mortality rates during the initial few years of kidney transplantation. However, the trend of outpatient admission is expected to continue during the forecast period owing to the low mortality rates among the outpatients.

England have taken a first innings lead over India following their 207 all out in their opening day's play at Lord's. India were in no position to defend it, bowled out for 411 in 134 overs as England's fast bowlers sunk their teeth into the Indian batsmen. England's total was made up from 77 by Ian Botham (103), 44 each by John Eales (107) and Nasser Hussein (70) and 102 from Jonathon Trott's bat.
England were the first team to win an Ashes Test at Lord's when they beat Australia 3-2 in 1982/83, and will be looking to repeat the feat this time around when their Ashes preparations continue today with another test between England and New Zealand starting in Auckland on Saturday.
Papua New Guinea 242-9 declared; Kenya 229; Kenya 174 for six wickets; Papua New Guinea 240
Kenya, who are touring PNG in readiness for next year's Commonwealth Games, declared after 144 overs of play as Papua New Guinea reached 242 for 9 declared in their first innings here tonight. In reply, Kenya's all-rounders showed good form as they raced to 174 for nine, their top score so far. Kenya's bowling attack began with 12 wickets falling in four sessions as they cruised to victory before the match was curtailed due to bad light. In response, PNG were all out for 229 runs, 133 for 5 wickets after being set a total of 143 for victory.
England 310 for five dec; New Zealand 310
New Zealand's record run-scorer Richard Hadlee continued his prolific bowling form as he took seven for 50 in New Zealand's second innings effort against England here today in Wellington. With England piling on the runs with the bat, Hadlee bowled India-loving Allan Lamb in the second hour of the day's play in his second spell, bringing back memories of Chris Cairns' hat-trick in 1983/84.
Lamb came out of retirement this summer to boost the England batting line-up.
The Test series against India gets under way in Auckland next week. India, who are currently hosting the Champions Trophy, will play three T20 Internationals in addition to a one-day international. Gender differences in survival after stroke: are these a matter of treatment?<sup>1</sup>

Jammu and Kashmir: The Land of Literature and Poetry
Humanities, in all its dimensions- History and heritage, culture and tradition- have come to be an important aspect of education system in India. They have always played a vital role in shaping and moulding society. This is evident from the fact that humanities education has been a major part of education system of Jammu and Kashmir for a long time. The university system in J&K, for instance, was established in the late nineteenth century. There were two universities in Jammu and Kashmir - Jammu University and Kashmir University.
As far as humanities are concerned, it is worth mentioning here about the existence of Jammu and Kashmir State Council for Higher Education (JKSCHE). The JKSCHE was started in 1988 with the sole aim of providing quality higher education and research in the area of Humanities. It is the only state body working on the issue of higher education in the area of Humanities. Since it's inception, JKSCHE has helped the State Government in establishing higher institutions in the fields of arts, languages and literature in a systematic manner. This has led to the establishment of many new institutions over past three decades which have helped in building human resources in the State and contributed in the socio-economic development of the State. At present, there are twenty five new and thirteen old institutions spread across different districts of the State. These institutions offer courses in Humanities, Arts and Language Studies. In addition, JKSCHE has also played a major role in the development of human resource by contributing in setting up several National Institutes of Languages like Central Institute of Languages in Srinagar, National Institute of Pakistan Studies in Jammu and University of Rajasthan in Jaipur.
While this article deals specifically with the contribution of JKSCHE to the development of Humanities in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, one should also take into consideration some of the efforts made by other higher institutions in the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Among these, Jammu University is the pioneer institution to provide full liberal arts course at graduate level in any part of the world. Other institutes like Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University at Katra and JKR Degree College for Women at Jammu, provide a liberal arts curriculum. Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi, has also started providng a liberal arts course since 2005. Similarly, JLN PG College, Srinagar offers a liberal arts course from the year 2010-2011. Other institutes offering liberal arts programme in the State include Baba Farid University of Paediatrics, Anantpur, Sargodha University, Multan and Muzaffarabad Public Library and Archives.
In terms of higher education in the area of Humanities, Jammu University is currently providing a regular Bachelor of Arts programmes in five majors viz: History, Political Science, English Literature, Religious Studies and Economics. Jamia Millia Islamia University too offers a regular Bachelor of Arts in ten majors viz: History

TweakMonitor: a memory profiler designed to highlight memory bottlenecks
By Paul Lilly published 8 May 13
It can help identify the causes of system slowdowns
In order to help improve PC performance, TweakMonitor can pinpoint memory leaks and provide valuable insight into how fast your system is running
While overclocking your CPU might get you some performance gains, there may be a price to pay at the system level. The TweakMonitor for Windows utility helps identify the causes of PC slowdowns, then provides a number of solutions. In this article we take a look at it.
TweakMonitor works by recording data about system performance at various points in time. It does this using a "timeline" feature that displays a snapshot of the past several minutes on screen. The goal here is to identify memory leaks and provide valuable insight into how fast your system is running.
After the initial install process, the program launches a memory diagnostic routine that walks through four main steps, including:
Collecting data from various locations about system memory. This includes: CPU, hard disk, virtual memory, and swap files.
Performing a memory load test that mimics a user session with a given command-line program.
Analyzing the results of the load test using a tool called VSStress.
Identifying patterns of system memory usage to help locate memory bottlenecks.
The process will continue until all memory areas have been checked.
Once completed, you can review the collected data, including graphical overviews of the data and detailed memory information in an XML format file. And since TweakMonitor was developed by PCBlog, it was built specifically for system administrators, but it also makes for a useful tool for laypersons.
I was surprised to find out that TweakMonitor supports system monitoring for all Intel platforms from Pentium 4 all the way up to Xeon Nehalem (2.8 and 3.2GHz) and Sandy Bridge processors. That means for example, if your laptop has two or four CPU cores and two or four GPU cores it should still be monitorized. However, I found one aspect of TweakMonitor that was not mentioned in the product description on the web site and that is the ability to profile system RAM.
I wondered whether this might be a possible use case for the tool but didn't find any indication of this functionality, so it seems like a limitation of the current version of

 How do you know when a bowstring is loose?
 It is important to pay attention to the strings of your bow when shooting arrows. Some strings are more sensitive than others and will make an arrow miss a target if they are out of alignment with the arrow's path. When a string is loose it can cause an arrow to miss by as much as thirty feet. To determine if a string is loose, try gently pulling on it from both sides without pushing hard. If one side of the string stretches while the other side does not stretch then the string is likely loose. If you can pull on both sides of the string at the same time it may be a little more difficult to detect but is generally possible. This can be done after shooting an arrow several times for extra reassurance.
Do all archers have loose strings? No, each archer has different tensions on their bows depending on their strength, weight, and sex. Archery is a sport that can be performed by anyone, no matter what their physical capabilities, so it should not be surprising that archers will sometimes experience bowstring slippage as part of shooting.
Do you need a medical background to shoot arrows? No, although a medical background can help understand the mechanics of arteries and how they work in a more accurate manner. Many people have no background in medicine and enjoy a day spent bowhunting. Arterial lines and blood pressure are often mistakenly assumed to equal arterial strength which is a common misconception among hunters.
What is the first thing a hunter should check on a wounded deer before leaving the scene? I always suggest the hunter check first on any wounded animal for bullet exit sites. Are there bullet entry/exit sites from multiple directions? Is the animal moving towards or away from me during the hunting session? Does it have injuries on the body surface in direct line with the muzzle of the gunshot wound?
What is the most common mistake made when hunting archers? The biggest mistake that hunters make when searching for archers is to focus on archers who shoot bows with long-handled quivers. Most archers use short-handled quivers for many reasons. First, the short handle of the quiver is a great place to throw arrow after arrow until they have been arched. Second, the arrow rests comfortably on top of the quiver for easy access. Last, the archer will often toss out arrows to test them prior to shooting them.
Is there a difference between archers who shoot crossbows and archers who shoot bows? Yes, there is a difference. Archers who shoot bows use less energy than archers who shoot crossbows. A crossbow allows the archer to move slower than the bow that was shot. This decreases the amount of energy needed to shoot an arrow. On average, a bow needs to be shot about 40 times to complete a full bowstrike. A crossbow needs to be fired about 10 times to complete a full bow strike. As a result, the average energy required to fire an arrow with a crossbow is less than the average energy required to fire an arrow with a bow.

I love this time of year. I love it very much! Christmas is coming soon and I can't wait for my kids to open their gifts from Santa Claus!! I wish them all the best and hope they all have a very Merry Christmas filled with lots of laughter and joy! This year my kids are getting older (yay!) so I am expecting more and more presents! It is wonderful seeing their faces light up when opening their presents but also very stressful sometimes because you never know what will come outta that wrapping paper and you don't want to ruin your kids' first surprise by tearing their gift open right away. So, we are doing our Christmas shopping now instead of later so we can relax and enjoy the moment before opening those gifts. Christmas shopping has already started at some stores like Macy's and Nordstrom but it only lasts until November 23rd! Some stores start on the 8th or 9th but I would rather be early than late! We will probably shop online too. If you are looking for an easy way to shop for someone else then try Groupon. You get all kinds of coupons and deals to choose from and you can even print out your shopping list!
As the days grow shorter and colder and my kids are getting older I love how Christmas seems to come around faster every single year! I can hardly wait to decorate the house! I bought these lights for the house last year and they look fabulous!
The tree is getting bigger everyday but I still need one more ornament so you may see me at Michael's shopping for just that one little thing next weekend!

 is an endometrial flare-up from anorectal flare-up similar to post-rectal flare-up? "The Messenger"
a film based on the book "The Messenger" by Mark Larkin. It's the true story of a group of young men in the early 1900s who volunteered as messengers for the Catholic priesthood in England, and later the whole of Europe in the aftermath of World War Two. It features some amazing stories of faith and sacrifice, but also a lot of pain, loss and grief. I was looking forward to the end of February and to some more winter sunny days in northern Illinois. It didn't work out that way. Not only did it snow every day this week; but at my house, at least half a dozen inches fell yesterday afternoon!

Fitness trackers have become increasingly popular in recent years. The reason why they're growing so rapidly? Because people want to stay healthy and active for life. That means they need help telling them whether they're getting anywhere close to those goals!
In 2012 there were just 15 trackers available—but now there's a full 78 fitness tracking options! What's even cooler is that they come in so many different colors and styles, so nobody ever needs to worry about their tracker looking uncool again. Check out the following list of some of the best-looking and coolest fitness trackers out there right now! We offer a full range of services for septic system repair including septic leaks, pumpouts, inspections and maintenance programs.

Cutting edge technology combined with years of experience. Septic cleaning, pumpout and preventive maintenance. Is there a new form of malnutrition, dementia-related? No, said a team of experts recently convened to address the problem. They concluded that there isn't a new form of nutritional depression: no deficits in long-chain fatty acids, carbohydrate energy sources, protein energy sources, or micronutrients.
However, the group noted some deficiencies in several micronutrient groups, primarily vitamin D, riboflavin, vitiligo, and iron. They cited several possible causes of these deficits, including increased nerve length between food consumed and absorbed nutrients, dietary patterns, and intrauterine and postnatal depression. In a world where it seems we always have someone to blame, the use of blame is a form of socially acceptable self-protection. However, blaming others for our own misfortune is not only immature, it may be counterproductive. We don't need a third party to understand that when we blame ourselves for something bad happening to us, it is our own internalized thoughts of self-worth, not external forces, which are at fault. Blame is a form of protecting ourselves against what we perceive as harmful external threats. Instead of finding ways to reduce our vulnerability to harm, we protect ourselves by finding ways to avoid our own inner harm and harm to others. We do this in order to protect our own self-esteem and avoid guilt, shame, or humiliation. These are some common defenses of blame: the denial of responsibility for one's own actions, the devaluing of one's own experiences, and the acceptance of responsibility for other's own actions.
Denial of responsibility means that the perpetrator believes he is totally responsible for his behavior without realizing he is making excuses to make himself feel better. The denier believes there must be somebody else to blame for his own actions. He accepts responsibility for all of the negative consequences of his actions even though some of these consequences were never intended by him and might have been avoidable. Often times the denier will blame others for

 "Ticks" as we know them is an acronym for a particular kind of tick: the medical "tick" and as it's name suggests, the medical and legal use of the term in a "tics" sense. When a doctor treating a patient reports tics, they are often speaking of their symptoms: "my son has tics" or "I saw my daughter ticked off during our family therapy session." A legal definition of a "tick" may be a "tickle," a "dickens," or a "lump." A "lump" in this context is an inflammatory mass within a body cavity. As a word used to diagnose ticks, "tick" has a number of meanings. The most common meaning is "infection from a tick" and can refer to any disease agent transmitted by means of a vector, especially a mosquito. (The virus in the human immune system that causes Chronic Lymphedema of the extremities is sometimes called a "tick virus.") In a less common usage, "tick" can also refer to any type of animal or insect infesting man. The term "tics" can mean a number of different things, but all of these have one thing in common: they are a nuisance. "Tick" can be associated with an infectious disease agent and the presence of disease in the environment, both of which are infectious hazards.
The use of "ticks" as a word to diagnose tick-borne diseases is not new. It's been used since at least 1927. A 1927 report by two American physicians describes the use of "tics" as an acronym to diagnose tick-borne diseases:
A: acute onset of unexplained weight loss; B: blood ticks; C: chronic wasting of the eyelids; D: development of oliguria and polyarteritis nodosa; E: exacerbations of chronic diseases, some of which are inhaled
That was back when "tick" referred to a medical illness: some infections are known as "ticks." It wasn't until 1986 that "tick" became a synonym for a tick-related disease: AIDS, tularemia, herpes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
The use of "tick" in reference to a tick-related disease emerged after the development of human immunocompetence: a response to tick-borne agents in the absence of a vaccine or other means of prevention. As such, "tick" as a diagnostic term may be a more recent phenomenon than the use of "tick" as a medical term.
The "tick" as a diagnostic term in relation to medical tick-related disease was not a new concept in 1986: as far back as 1875, a physician described the use of "tick" in connection with tuberculosis:
"It is with some reluctance I must admit to writing you about a case of baculum enteropathogenicus which I had in my practice, but I have no hesitation in relating a case of tuberculous enterocolitis, in which the microbe, if not the disease, came in the guise of a tick"
The term "tick" and its medical/legal use is now widely recognized as a synonymous diagnostic term for tick-related disease: HIV, tularemia, herpes and influenza. Is a special interest in laparoscopy indicated in all obgyns?

 Q: How do you enable/disable a feature for users in ADUC? I am trying to enable a feature for a specific group of users in Active Directory User and Computing Cases, but it doesn't seem to be available under ADFC. Does anybody know if it's available there or somewhere else?
I want to enable the "Enable computer features" button for the users of one domain that are in a specific group.

A: It is not available at all levels of user account management in ADUC, either at the account level or the user account level. It only is available at the group level - see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/enable-computer-features-at-the-group-level-in-aduc-for-active-directory-users#enable-computer-features-at-the-group-level.
You can enable/disable these features via Group Policy. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970524(v=ws.10).aspx?f=%22Enable%20computer%20features%22%2C+%22disable%22%2C+%22en_us%22. (If this link does not work on your system, you may need to disable Javascript first.) 
 Q: How do you make a function return an integer array as an answer in Mathematica? For example, I have the following code:
n = 3;
f[k_, n_] := k + O[n];
sum[i_][k_] := Sow[{i, f[k, n]}];

I would like sum[2][2][1][1], sum[2][2][1][2] but Mathematica only accepts numerical values. Any ideas how I could change sum so I could get integers back?

A: sum[k_][j_]:={{k, f[j, n]}}


A: One solution is to use
sum[i_][k_][j_]:=(Sow[{i, j}][j]);


A: You probably already did it:
sum[k_][j_]=Sow[{k, f[j, n]}]

 Q: How to extract the first column of the result of a call to get_data from an R object I'm making some data manipulation in R and was wondering what the best way is to extract just the first column of results from a call to get_data using dplyr. I'd like to compare a column of interest in my response against a similar column in a reference frame in order to determine differences in our response between the groups defined by the reference frame. It looks something like this:
response_dat <- read_excel("response_dat.xlsx")
reference_frame <- read_excel("reference_frames.xlsx")

reference_frame$colA_ref <- reference_frame$colA
response_dat$colA_res <- get_data(response_dat,"colA",type="ref")
response_dat$colB_res <- get_data(response_dat,"colB",type="ref")

In response_dat I've got a column of interest: colA_ref. In reference_frames I've got two columns of interest: colA and colB. But when I try a subset of 80% of the columns, I get an error: Error in `[<-`(`*tmp*`, 80, use.na = FALSE): invalid type name
> response_dat %>% filter(colA %in% reference_frame$colA_ref) %>% dplyr::filter(colB %in% reference_frame$colB_ref) %>% 
       select(colA) %>% dplyr::select(-colB)
Error in `[<-`(`*tmp*`, 80, use.na = FALSE): invalid type name


A: I think you should try something different than dplyr::select to remove the na_cols in the reference_frames. For example, you can try to subset by the same column names (

 user The world's secondhand market is a thriving industry, with a lot of potential for growth. Many factors can contribute to the popularity of secondhand goods, but one factor is the desire to conserve, or even to obtain. less. firsthand. used items, than secondhand goods. Many of us are more environmentally conscientious now than we were ten years ago. We also want our children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities as we did. We want them to experience new things, meet new people, and learn from other cultures and perspectives than our own. This desire is not just a luxury of the middle class; all families can benefit from the secondhand market. We also don't need expensive items to be happy. everyone has a right to a good education. a good meal at lunchtime. and a safe home. every family has the right to a healthy environment. the world has the ability to create a better future for itself, if it will choose to do so. Let's start by choosing wisely. 1 UNDP's Support to Civil Society Organisations in the Americas: from Partnership to Implementation
by UNDP Americas December 28, 2018
"UNDP is one of many international development agencies that provide technical assistance to civil society organisations in the Americas. In the mid-1990s, UNDP began partnering with civil society organisations in efforts to address structural barriers and challenges they face. Today, UNDP's support to civil society is not limited to technical advice and implementation of interventions. It is more about working towards results and sustainable impact of the work of civil society". Read more in "UNDP's Support to Civil Society Organizations in the Americas: from Partnership to Implementation", a publication launched on December 13th 2018 in Bogotá.
The publication presents information gathered during the preparation of the report "Uptake of Development Policies in Latin America and the Caribbean: is there evidence of diffusion of public sector innovations?", which analysed the uptake of public policy innovations in the region between 2008 and 2015. The report shows that while the uptake of public sector innovations has been mixed in the region, the majority of the policies have been implemented with fewer bars to entry than expected. However, there is room for improvement. Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States

The Los Angeles Coalition for Health Equity was established in March 2008 to coordinate public health response to the opioid crisis in Los Angeles County. Through funding from Drug Free Communities grants and other sources, the LA Coalition for Health Equity works to build public health capacity among LA County coalitions and jurisdictions. With the increasing number of patients with diabetes mellitus in the general medical outpatient clinics, the authors created a clinical process which could reliably provide diabetes care for all patients. Using clinical process indicators as proxies for diabetes care, a clinically effective process of diabetes care for all patients was created. This paper reports on the validation of the clinically effective process of diabetes care. Validity data from a sampling of data in the diabetes care process were collected using the Extended Discrete-time Simultaneous Extrapolation Approach. Using these valid data, the process was shown to be reliable enough for use as the basis for a diabetes care algorithm. With the use of lasers, there is a possible way to remove unwanted tattoos without any scarring. Tattoo removal with Nd:YAG laser works fast and without any side effects on a tattoo over fourteen years old. This means people don't necessarily have to replace a damaged tattoo, and they can keep the same one they started with. But the tattoo removal process works differently on each person.
The Nd:YAG laser is a non-ablative laser, meaning the laser does not break down tattoos nor the skin surrounding them. Instead, it stimulates the growth of collagen around the tattoo. When the collagen is ready, the pigment within the tattoo will then turn gray over the course of three months. The collagen will also eventually fall off of the skin and the tattoo will be gone

Previous Previous post: How can roboticists learn to teach? A new system of health care financing that relies on individual responsibility, accountability and responsibility of care, will have a significant impact on reducing the long-term cost of care. It also makes sense since we know more than ever before about the costs of medical care in this country and in other countries.
"HMOs," the primary emphasis of the debate over Medicare Part A, would simply be replaced by a system similar to Medicare Part A for Medicare beneficiaries, while having the additional benefit of individual responsibility. Each Medicare beneficiary would be required to pay into a Health Care Benefit Plan ("HCBP") like the Medicare Part A beneficiary has been required to do for nearly forty years. The HCBP would be based upon the individual's actual monthly income and not on family or household size or composition. Each Medicare beneficiary would make annual contributions towards their own "share" of Medicare Part A benefits. These contributions could vary between $50 and $5,000 each year depending upon the Medicare beneficiary's age and/or level of income and would be adjusted annually for inflation. They would go towards Medicare Part A "risk sharing." In short, Medicare beneficiaries would be responsible for a portion of their Medicare Part A benefits in addition to the traditional premium contribution made by taxpayers.
Medicare beneficiaries would also be responsible for meeting certain Medicare Part A benefits "gap" coverage under the plan. Medicare beneficiaries' individual responsibilities would be met through a combination of Medicare Part A benefits paid for using the individual's own money or with Medicare beneficiary contributions, Medicare Part A benefits paid for using Medicare beneficiary funds or Medicare beneficiary funds plus a premium paid by Medicare beneficiaries themselves, Medicare Part A benefits paid for Medicare beneficiary contributions alone, or Medicare beneficiaries contributing to Medicare Part A benefits in any combination. Medicare beneficiaries, however, would be able to choose whether they want to contribute toward their Medicare Part A benefits or not, thus making Medicare beneficiaries free to opt out of Medicare Part A altogether if they want to.
All Medicare beneficiaries would be charged the same Medicare Part A "deductible" for Medicare Part A benefits. Medicare beneficiaries would also receive Medicare Part A benefits after they reached retirement age. Medicare beneficiaries would still be eligible to enroll in Medicare Part A benefits in later life, but at an increased benefit level because Medicare beneficiaries would be responsible for more Medicare Part A benefits than Medicare beneficiaries as of retirement age. Medicare beneficiaries would, however, continue to be eligible to enroll in Medicare Part A benefits at no charge at age seventy five, or whenever Medicare beneficiaries choose to retire, as long as Medicare beneficiaries are not otherwise covered under Medicare Part A or Medicare Part A and B benefits, and Medicare beneficiaries are not otherwise covered under Medicare Part A or Medicare Part A benefits. Medicare beneficiaries would also, upon reaching retirement age, cease receiving Medicare Part A benefits.
To compensate for Medicare beneficiaries' greater risk of hospital discharges from skilled nursing facilities, Medicare beneficiaries would be required to pay into a Medicare Part A "surg

Vera joined the faculty at the University of Toronto in 2015 after teaching high school English for fourteen years, most recently as Professor of English at the University of Waterloo. Before that she taught in secondary schools as an English teacher and an advisor. Vera has also taught postsecondary composition courses; she holds a Certificate in Academic Writing from the Language Testing and Assessment Program at York University. Her doctoral dissertation examined the use of non-narrative storytelling in composition classrooms. Her scholarship examines the use of non-narrative storytelling in composition classrooms and her current work looks at the relationship between storytelling and non-storytelling within the composition classroom. Vera's other publications explore the relationship between literacy and identity in students' narratives. Recently, her research has looked at the use of non-narrative storytelling by post-secondary students as a means of exploring their identities as francophone Canadians. This is part of a larger project to examine francophone students' literacy practices both within and outside the francophone public school system.

Vera Lacey's teaching focus is on writing pedagogy. She believes in the power of storytelling to improve writing skills among post-secondary students. Her own teaching experiences have informed her teaching with an emphasis on writing across the curriculum. Writing instruction needs to be grounded in students' knowledge of their reading and writing selves, and writing pedagogy needs to meet those knowledge base needs. Vera works directly with students' stories and uses her knowledge of writing self-efficacy to create classroom environments where students are able to write effectively. She is interested in how to enhance student writing self-efficacy as students develop their writing pedagogies in order to facilitate their writing development. In this spirit, her current research examines the relationship between the number of writing assignments students complete per semester and their future career pathways. Vera is working with students' narratives about their future career goals in order to understand these career trajectories. Ultimately, she wants students' writing futures to be determined by their stories of writing self-efficacy. This paper reports a 3-month longitudinal study using patient-controlled outcome measures in a primary care clinic setting. We aimed to determine the reliability of self-reported outcome measures and investigate whether there were differences in terms of health care benefit utilization between patients who reported self-rated health care benefits eligibility and those who did not. In addition, we aimed to determine whether there was an association between self-reported health care benefits eligibility status and medical care use. Thirteen091 Medicare Part A beneficiaries in Maine received one 3-month update of their self-reported outcomes at baseline and then again at 3 months. Our analysis included all Medicare Part A beneficiaries with at least 1 Medicare Part A beneficiary outcome update during the 3 month period. Overall, 82% of Medicare Part A beneficiaries met Medicare Part A eligibility criteria. Using a sample of 768 Medicare Part A beneficiaries who completed an outcome measure at baseline, we found no significant differences in terms of the use of medicines, medical care, or services among beneficiaries who reported self-rated eligibility status compared to beneficiaries who did not report self-rated eligibility status. At follow-up, 112 beneficiaries reported Medicare Part A self-rated eligibility status. Of these 112 beneficiaries, 48% reported Medicare Part A self-rated eligibility status at follow-up, but only 15% reported Medicare Part A benefits utilization during the initial 3 months of the study.

Preparing data for analysis is a laborious task, especially when the data are large and diverse. However, there are ways to speed up the process. These include: 1) filtering out low-risk items; 2) using data mining techniques; and 3) aggregating data into simple measures of outcome.
 These approaches have been shown to significantly reduce the time required for data processing. <– Chapter 12: Data Analysis #1655

Now, if you are unfamiliar with the concept of spammering, check this article. Spammering involves posting non-spammy content about a specific topic or game in order to lure others into clicking links to clickable ads or into playing your game. I have never really thought much of this kind of advertising as being worthwhile because most of these spammers have been doing it for a while now and most of their players have left the game. This is probably why the game has such a high user retention rate of almost 90%!
I have however always enjoyed some of the posts made by other Rage fans and I am always happy when someone mentions something related to Rage. But I am not a spammer and I certainly never intend to be one. I am always happy to hear about the fun things happening in the Rage community whether those posts come from me or somebody else! So after thinking about it, I decided I would be the first spammer to write about spammering and how I really feel about it. I know a lot of people get a kick out of spamming and even some of them seem to have a legitimate interest in spamming. I myself just want my posts read!
Maybe I should just stop writing about this topic altogether and let the topic of spammering lurk in the back of everyone's mind until one day we are all sick of hearing about it and stop mentioning it! I mean how many people are still reading this page? Is anybody still clicking the link to my post?

Would a barefoot Pagan wedding be accepted and celebrated in a traditional Christian way? Would a couple consider going barefoot for their Pagan wedding? Would it be considered a "non-traditional" wedding? Are there any cultural differences between Pagans and Christians concerning the rituals of marriage? Or is the Pagan wedding just an extension of a wedding celebrated in an unconventional way?
A Barefoot Pagan wedding might be a special and unique occasion for both you and your partner. I say'maybe' because most Pagans don't celebrate their weddings religiously but have spiritual wedding ceremonies. In fact many have done away with the church ceremony all together and celebrated a Pagan ceremony within the Catholic/Christian context. Many are still holding onto the idea of having a wedding, but not a religious ceremony. You'll also find that the wedding is an important part of Pagan initiation ceremonies. You can take a look at my article on Pagan wedding traditions here.
The question is, what culture celebrates a traditional "wedding"? The wedding, for many, may not be as important as it is for Christians. Is it common practice among many cultures? Will a couple's non-traditional wedding be recognized in a traditional Christian fashion? As a Pagan wedding is an integral part of the Pagan initiation ritual it's possible that they will be recognized as a non-traditional wedding in the church, but what about in the pagan community itself?
The answer lies in the traditions of the individual couple. Is a pagan Barefoot wedding really considered a non-traditional wedding?
You may decide that no matter what you will have a Pagan wedding. It may very well be considered a non-traditional wedding to other pagans, but if two people are

Are you considering a career as a business analyst? You may have heard that it is usually a prerequisite to enter the field of business analysis that one have a bachelor's degree. Doing so will certainly not necessarily make you a more proficient business analyst. In fact, there are certain elements of the position that are only applicable for those who do not possess a bachelor's degree. The key to success with a business analyst role is understanding these common misconceptions and becoming familiar with the reality of what it really takes to be a successful business analyst.
Those who are in favor of requiring a bachelor's degree before entering the field of business analysis often cite two major factors: experience and education. These factors are often quoted as the primary reasons why employers don't want to hire people who do not have a bachelor's degree as a business analyst. But is this true? Let's examine each of these reasons in greater detail to see if they hold any weight.
1) Experience: Many argue that having some level of work experience makes people better business analysts, but this logic fails to consider several major factors that prevent people from achieving successful business analyst status without a bachelor's degree. First, just because someone has been working at his or her current job for fourteen years does not mean that he or she can contribute meaningfully as a business analyst over fourteen years without a bachelor's degree. Second, having years of experience in another field does not mean that person is qualified to perform the duties of a business analyst. Third, a lack of experience can be overcome with the right amount of training and practice. For example, many successful business analysts have limited experience but have a lot of training and practice. Lastly, no matter how experienced someone thinks he or she is, he or she can always learn new skills and approaches to doing things. These skills and approaches are valuable and are always needed by anyone looking to enter the position of a business analyst. No matter what level of experience someone might think he or she has as a business analyst, the reality is that it takes time, effort, and skill to become a successful business analyst.
2) Education: Many arguments against requiring a business analyst candidate to have a college degree, specifically a bachelor's degree, make sense on paper; however, these arguments often miss crucial facts about the position of a business analyst. A business analyst doesn't simply write reports and prepare spreadsheets; he or she is a member of the team of professionals responsible for delivering value to customers by developing software systems. These software systems need to be usable and maintainable, so a business analyst must understand how to use the various tools and technologies available to develop useful software. Furthermore, a business analyst must be proficient in communicating technical information to non-technical managers and users alike. Without some level of education in the subject matter of business analysis, a business analyst cannot fulfill these roles. Therefore, it should be mandatory for all potential candidates for a business analyst role to obtain a bachelor's degree before entering into the field.
These are just two examples of the numerous misconceptions held by people

I've been spending a lot of time this weekend getting ready for tomorrow. This has made me realize how often I need to be reminded of my responsibilities as a mom and wife. In between the cleaning, cooking, laundry, caring for the house, and caring for our kids it is easy to forget that we have a job to do!
The day after Thanksgiving we celebrated with my husband's side of the family and it was a beautiful day. We did all of the normal things (kid activities, a nice dinner at a family friend's home, and a long walk on a warm Fall afternoon) but one of the coolest things about having kids who can walk by themselves is being able to spend some time just enjoying their energy and personality while they are walking. Last Saturday when we went out for our walk I stopped to take a few pictures of this fun kiddo. She was running and jumping so hard I couldn't catch her. Instead of running away she decided to run right into a pile of leaves (which she quickly and gleefully pulled up) and then proceeded to kick the leaves off her feet. Then she ran across the grass, stopped again, and took another jump in the leaves. It was hilarious!!
A little over two months ago one of my sisters got married! My niece Emily married the boy next door and I had such a wonderful time watching her walk down the aisle as her father walked her past the guests. This was one of my favorite pictures taken during the reception--my brother-in-law was one happy camper!
On Sunday evening, after a few days without much TV, we were blessed to have the pleasure of seeing my nephew's home football game on TV. While my sister and I stayed upstairs in the living room cheering him on, my husband and daughter made a visit to the downstairs family room to watch a movie while they both worked on their crafts projects (no more stapler free days!) The kids had a great time watching the game together. Even though it rained most of the afternoon and evening the family room was cozy with a big screen tv and the perfect noise level for a good ol' football game. After the big victory my nephew and his teammates all came in to see us and give us all a congratulations kiss--it was adorable.
Later that night my niece and her fiancé, Matt, welcomed baby girl number four (and the fifth grandchild) into the world. As always, she is the sweetest bundle and our entire family could not be happier. It was a beautiful, exciting, joyful day! Happens sometimes when I try to add a photo to an existing post.
Is it just me? If anyone else experiences this it would be helpful to know why this happens as well as the solution.

 assistant  řáňů řáňů řáňů řáňů řáňů řáňů řáňů Die Schaalverwijnen sind ein kleines Dorf im westlichen Niederloos, einem Gemeindebezirk der niederländischen Provinz Limburg. Sie gehörten zur altenburgischen Amtsgemeinde (Bezirk) Beek. Ihre Zugehörigkeit zu diesem Landkreis ist seit dem 15. Jahrhundert belegt.

Sie gehören zu den kleinste Gemeindeteile des Kreises (Kreis) Nieuw-Limburg und werden durch deren Ortsbezeichnungen gekennzeichnet.

Beschreibung 
Schaalverwijnen, also Verwijnen, werden in ihren Ortsnamen nicht erklärt. Mit ändernamen wird meistens noch nicht verwechselt worden. Verwijnen kann man unter anderem auch als Verwinnung von Waffen hervorheben ›werden verkränkt‹, womit die Schaalverwijnen einen Teilbereich mit Waffenabzug abgrenzen. Im weiteren Sprechtdeutschen wird als Wortschatz des Niederländeres (Niederländerisch) abgekürzt Schaalverwijnen (Niederlandisch).  Dieser Artikel schreibt die Gemeindebezeichnung Schaalverwijnen nieder.

Lage und Fläche 

Nordwesten Niederloos 
Die Ortsteile sind nordwestlich, östlich und nördlich der heutigen Stadt Lingeldael mitten im Niederloos. An einer Stelle im Nordwesten Niederloos liegt das ehemalige Gemeindekleeburg (Veenendaal). Südsüdöst Südende Osten Süden Südost östlich ist das Amt (Durchbodenbereich) Hoge Bokhove (Niedergut) (Hoogdijk). Hier grenzen die Städte Beek an der Niedergutbühne bzw. Aalten aan de Veerse Maas an der Niedergutbrücke über.

Alle Ortsteile sind durch Schaalveilen durchflosset, so dass Schaalverwijnen überall mit Wasser versorgt werden. Außerdem können Schaalverwijnen zu anderen Quellenstromen zähliglich Wasser führen.

Gemeindestadteilungen 
In einer Verwaltungsgemeinschaft, die eine selbstständige Kommunalverwaltung hat, kann man Gemeindesteile (gemeischt) nennen. Gemeindestele kann man von diesen Begrifflichkeitennamen abscheiden: Gemeine Steinwälle (Vegum, Vem, Weeze), Gemeine Slotwijndraagsteele (Nijmegen, Nidder), Gemeine Lange Wand (IJsseloever, Kerkrade), Gemeine Spontane Werken (Motorwerken, Schaalverwijnen, Stikkelwolven), Gemeine Nadelwälle (Dendermonde), Gemeine Schaalverwijnen. Durch die zahlreichen Steilfälle und ihre Nahrungsträger im Schaalwiel ist eine bewegliche Landschaft vorhanden.

Angelegenes Gebiet 
Angelegenes Gebiet von Schaalverwijnen liegt an der Niedergutbühne sowie bei Veenendaal, Wanbeek und Vulker in einem südlichen Bereich des Niederguts. An dieser Niedergutbühne entspringen alle folgenden Wasserströmmen, sodass ein großes, zusammenhängendes Gewässerprofil (Kanalprofil) nachgewiesen ist. Die Bewohner von Schaalverwijnen haben sich hier ihre eigene Kellendienerei entwickelt, so dass sie neben den Steilen ihrer Landegräber mit ihren Stollen Wasser für ihre Hausbewohnerschaft leisten konnten.

Kellendienerei 
Ein kleiner Teil der ehemaligen Bevölkerungsleistung in Schaalverwijnen besteht aus der Steilkellendienerei. Die kellendienerische Arbeitsfelder sind an den südlichen Niederloösener Orten (Voorwijzer, Rijkewijk, De Schaal, Noordpoort) an der Niedergutbühne und südlich der ehemaligen Niedergutstraße (Veenen, Zeeseveld) gelegen. Die Arbeiter aus der niederländischen Kellendiliter-Arbeit sind anfangs aus allen Regionen geflü

A new study from the University of Minnesota assessed the long-term effects of public awareness campaigns targeting pharmaceutical industry marketing practices. It is one of several articles recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Health Communication aimed at helping the public understand pharmaceutical industry marketing tactics and strategies to combat misinformation in media and advertising. The other articles review current research literature to identify what works to counter industry influence in media and advertisements, and suggest strategies that can be used by consumers to avoid or reduce the likelihood of misinformation in marketing messages. These studies will hopefully help consumers make informed health care decisions so they get the best value out of their medicines.
In addition to the Journal of Health Communication articles, other research shows the public is becoming increasingly aware of pharmaceutical industry marketing tactics. As the public becomes more informed about the connection between pharmaceutical marketing expenditures and Medicare Part A beneficiaries' access to prescription drugs, it is critical the Medicare beneficiary population does not lose access as a result of pharmaceutical marketing efforts. These are just some of the reasons why it is important for pharmaceutical companies to spend adequate marketing funds on beneficial public education and prevention activities to ensure Medicare beneficiaries receive the maximum value out of their Medicare Part A drug benefits while reducing Medicare Part A beneficiaries' dependence on prescription drugs.
The Medicare beneficiary population currently has $1.5 trillion worth of Medicare Part A benefits yet spends 40% of its Medicare Part A beneficiaries' Medicare benefit dollars on prescriptions. In addition, Medicare beneficiaries have historically become more dependent on prescription medications in recent years as Medicare beneficiaries' spending has increased each year. Medicare beneficiaries' dependency on prescription medications may adversely impact Medicare beneficiaries' long-term quality of life, Medicare beneficiaries' ability to work and Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare coverage after retirement. Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A benefits currently cover 87% of Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A beneficiaries' Medicare Part A Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare Part A beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare benefici

Even the smallest children can work magic, and as a child myself I was always fascinated by people who could work wonders with their hands or who knew how to create magical things out of nothingness. When I was younger and a budding magician in my own right, I always hoped one day to have my very own crystal ball.

Inspired by the fairy tale character of the same name, the Crystal Ball is a 3-sided playing-card trick, similar to the 78 cards Trick, however it's more unusual than that, as it combines a number of traditional deck-tricks together into a coherent whole, while the Trick is dealt separately. Like many of the other 3-sided tricks in the Deck-Trick section, the Crystal Ball involves a card cutter which can be used in any of several standard tricks. In addition to using this deck-cutter, some versions include special decks, in particular, the Pendulum and the Flower Tricks, so there is also a selection of decks for the Crystal Ball. It is generally not necessary to own both a card cutter and a deck of cards; the trick is performed with either one.

This trick has been recorded by over 200 magicians and it is listed in the books of many prominent magicians including David Angell and Robert Tilton. It has been filmed extensively, most notably by the British magic studio Penn & Teller.

History

Early versions of the Crystal Ball involved using the same card cutter as in the Pendulum Trick, but this was problematic because it was difficult to shuffle and cut cards well in the same hand. In 1978, the first "official" version of the trick was created by Ken McMurray, called The Crystal Ball (TM), but he never published it. Instead, he passed it off as his own version of The Flower Ball, using the same card cutter as in The Flower Ball and omnipresence of the card cutter as a universal common denominator, thus avoiding the problems inherent in the use of a non-universal denominator in a universal common denominator. He then began selling a deck of The Crystal Ball cards as part of his Flower Tricks. Later versions of The Crystal Ball were made available, including some with a common denominator.

The first official version of The Crystal Ball appeared in 1981 after a brief hiatus in the mid-1980s, written by Penn & Teller and released in their book The Magic Castle Handbook. This version had a common denominator for each card and used the same card cutter as in the Flower Ball, and therefore eliminated the need to have two different decks of cards. However, the Flower Tricks and The Crystal Ball decks still use a card cutter of the same type as in the Flower Tricks.

Almost twenty years later in 2006, Penn & Teller released another version of The Crystal Ball, now featuring their own version of the card cutter, a version with an all new universal denominator (but still requiring a deck of cards). Some of these newer versions of The Crystal Ball also have a common denominator for each card. While there have been minor changes in design and methodology since the first edition, it remains one of the most popular and recognizable decks in the world of illusions today. It is included in the collections of David Angell and David Copperfield, among others.

The Crystal Ball is also a popular choice for beginners performing magical card tricks, being simple enough to learn quickly without requiring a lot of specialist knowledge of magic. It is typically performed in the same way as the Pendulum Trick. Unlike the Pendulum Trick, however, this version is often performed with the Flower Tricks decks, and usually with the card cutter included in the deck, but it is still a suitable introduction to deck magic. Because the Crystal Ball is performed with only one card at a time, the trick is more difficult than the Trick itself to perform. It is also the only magic trick described by David Angell in which the performer actually touches the audience

The cover of Velvet Is Forever. I love how the artwork captures this vintage feel to the book, but I hate how the title font screams that it's a horror novel.
Velvet Is Forever is the story of a group of college friends on vacation together in upstate New York and the secret they've been keeping from one another for over ten years. It seems they were all involved in the disappearance of a young woman from a nearby university, but they never spoke of it again. Then one night while exploring an abandoned cabin, they make a shocking discovery which shakes their world as we know it. The novel is told from multiple perspectives, and I was surprised at how fast-paced it felt. It started slow, but then picked up steam and had me guessing almost every chapter. The ending also left some open-ended questions which I was eager to see answered moving forward in the series. I really enjoyed Velvet Is Forever!
 A few months ago I met a fellow traveller for a coffee in Leeds who also happens to be a photographer. It is often said that photography is just a hobby. But, I asked her about the motivation behind her daily snaps, and she didn't hesitate: "Every day there are interesting sights or people around me and I simply like to capture them". Not long after we made plans for our next outing and I have to say I agree with her motto. While travelling there are always so many amazing spots to be discovered in cities all across Europe, and sometimes further afield, but even when you're in a new city you discover something new almost everyday.
This might be the reason why so many travellers prefer to keep camera in their hand or purse during travels. There's no better way to capture the city than to visit the most hidden corners and spots. There is also not any better way to explore a place other than to step outside of your hotel room and start walking around. You only get the best views when you're doing it yourself and don't need a guide telling you where to go or what to do. Plus, there is also this adrenaline rush of going for walks that you normally wouldn't dare in a city you already know. You can easily walk into unknown territory and explore your own city. This is one of the main reasons why people continue to travel solo.
But let's talk about solo travel in general for a bit. I think every traveller has his/her own opinion about solo travel and it is not always easy to find others who agree with him. According to a survey done by the Huffington Post and Travel Talk Online in 2017, solo travelers spend less time traveling alone, get stuck in traffic more often, and end up missing their flight more often compared to couples. Yet, according to another survey done by the same two organizations in 2016, more people than ever are planning to go solo this year. It seems that there is a growing trend towards solo travel among millennials and some other groups. However, if I have to put a number on the number of solo travelers out there, I would say it's somewhere between 1% and 15%. 
That being said, if you're planning to travel solo on your first big trip or if you want to explore a destination without having anyone else around you, these tips below should help. 
Solo Travelling: tips and tricks to make it a successful experience 
If I look back at my first ever solo trip, I still recall feeling a mixture of emotions: joy, happiness, excitement, and apprehension mixed together. My first solo trip to Thessaloniki seemed so surreal to me because I didn't know anybody at all and yet I felt right at home. In fact, the day before I left for Greece I decided to explore the town just a little bit more and took my first walk through its alleys in the evening, alone. Since

Is there a difference in the use of carotid intima media thickness measurement between black Africans and whites? The Eye Bank of Quebec (EBQ) is an association of ophthalmological donation organizations. It was formed in 1987 by ophthalmologists from Quebec who wished to pool their experience in the field of ocular autotransfusion. Its mission is to contribute to improve ocular survival rates for patients requiring transfusion or transplantation by developing and promoting a better knowledge of blood products and their use.
Today, the EBQ's mission is to promote better transfusion practice in Quebec and Canada and facilitate the acquisition of ocular autotransfused solutions for patients who need them. By doing so it ensures their availability, safety and efficacy while promoting the principles of autotransfusion. This goal is achieved through the cooperation of ophthalmological donor centers, public health services, educational institutions and other organizations that deal with ocular transfusion. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIH stroke scale) has been validated for the early detection of stroke patients with dementia at admission. It can provide early assessment of patients with stroke who may require less invasive stroke care than those without dementia, while reducing the potential for stroke medication errors. However, there are limitations to its use as a screening tool, particularly among elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the majority of whom will not meet criteria for stroke in the first week of admission. In addition, the NIH stroke scale's reliance on self-reported stroke symptoms is a major limitation. We hypothesized that MCI patients will have less cognitive deficit than non-MCI patients with respect to stroke outcome at admission. Does the NIH stroke scale's reliance on self-reported stroke symptoms reduce the potential for stroke medication errors among elderly patients with MCI?<br> <br> Using data from the Veterans Administration Geriatric Outreach Program, we evaluated Medicare Part A beneficiaries who received stroke care from July 2010 - December 2013 and were enrolled in the program at any time during this period. We analyzed Medicare Part A beneficiary data at the hospital level for both stroke patients with cognitive impairment (non-MCI) and MCI. We used

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale  is a multidisciplinary stroke assessment tool which has been found useful for making rapid stroke neuropsychological assessments. Neuropsychological tests are performed by a member of the neuropsychology service in the Stroke Outreach Program and recorded into a patient's chart. The scores from the stroke assessment tool are then reported to the neuropsychologist.already present? or not present? at the stroke consultation, so they can use this information to guide decision making about treatment initiation and discharge.

The appendixes of Volume II provide the reader with a wealth of information on a host of subjects relating to American Catholic history: statistics on American Catholic population, immigration patterns, birth rates, mortality rates, education levels of Catholics and non-Catholics, employment of Catholics, family life, etc. An appendix was included in both volumes of History of the Catholic Faith in America because a great deal of detailed statistical information was considered too sensitive to publish in the text itself. The "Lasers in Pediatric Surgery: a New Approach for the Treatment of Pediatric Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors??" study was performed by researchers who specialize in the surgical management of pediatric gastrointestinal tract neuroendocrine cancer. In their recent publication, "Laparoscopic myomectomy: is it contraindicated in neonatal testicular torsion?", they questioned whether myomectomy can be performed laparoscopically in cases of neonatal testicular torsion.
Neoenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine tumor is a rare cancer of the gastric and oesophageal types. There are no guidelines for the management of these types of tumours in children and adults alike. Accordingly, we hypothesized that myomectomy could be contraindicated in case of neonatal testicular torsion? However, we do not know whether myomectomy should always be contraindicated in such cases. Therefore, we decided to investigate this question and performed a retrospective analysis of 387 patients with neonatal testicular torsion between January 2004 and December 2013. No myomatous lesions were detected in patients undergoing myomectomy. We also examined the medical records of patients with gastric cancer between 1988 and 2012 and myomas in gastric carcinoma were documented in 18% of all cases. Our results suggest myomectomy may be performed in laparoscopic neonatal testicular torsion. There is increasing interest in the use of computerised tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of cervical cancer. It is thought to reduce the radiation exposure associated with computed tomography of the neck of the uterine cervix. However, there have been reports of CT scout images in the uterine cervical nodes misinterpreted as abnormalities in patients with cervical cancer. We describe two examples of potential misinterpretations of CT scout images. In a world where people are growing increasingly anxious about how their personal data is being used, companies are getting creative when marketing to potential customers.
Consumerism, with its attendant data harvesting practices, has become such a central part of daily life that it is nearly impossible to avoid it completely.
As a result, more and more marketers are trying different ways to hook consumers without necessarily having them sell out their personal information.
The key to success is understanding your audience. This means knowing exactly what motivates them and meeting their needs—both

Taylor Luckey threatened a police officer with a kitchen knife. After the standoff, he was taken to a local hospital where he was treated for his wounds before being booked into jail on charges of aggravated assault.with a deadly weapon and resisting arrest.
Luckey is expected to make a court appearance Tuesday afternoon at the Douglas County Courthouse.
"He's an immediate threat to other officers and the community," said Sgt. Chad Gavin, a spokesman for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. "He's a danger to himself as well as everyone else."
He is still considered armed and dangerous, Gavin said.
Luckey also has a warrant out of Lincoln County, Colorado for violation of the terms of his probation. The Lincoln County incident is unrelated to the standoff in Douglas County, according to Gavin. 7000 PETITE-SIBÈS, 10001 PETITE-FRANÇONT

Mutual aid between Pérols and Saint-Sébastien-de-la-Riviere
During the week of 4 July, 7000 Pétite-Sibèrs, who are based in Saint-Sébastien-de-la-Riviere, were called up to offer their assistance to their comrades from Pérols, who are based there, after a serious car accident. Their colleagues from Pérols made use of this mutual aid to repair the damage sustained by a bus in Pérols and transport 7000 Pétite-Sibèrs there. Apart from transport, there were no other means of transport available to send the injured to a hospital in Saint-Émery. However, when they arrived in Saint-Sébastien-de-la-Rivière, the situation was already critical. In addition to the 7000 Pétite-Sibèrs who helped to provide this assistance, 200 volunteers (including the parents of 300 children who are based in Pérols) and a dozen motorcycles with ambulance lights also offered their assistance. It was thanks to these volunteers that a helicopter took off towards Saint-Émery. In return, they are due to be repaid for their assistance.
A specialist team also travelled to Saint-Émery to assess the damage and organise the transport of the injured. Among them is a neurology specialist with the department of acute stroke, who will continue her care of the patients while the specialised neuropsychological assessment continues. Her intervention in Saint-Eymery was carried out using a mobile stroke unit. Another specialist, with the department of emergency radiotherapy, is carrying out a complementary treatment.
For more information about mutual aid, please contact the Service de Protection sociale à Saint-Émery-de-Pont-Jude on 03 77 55 24 12 or on 03 77 55 24 18.

This week I have been making my own food in the mornings and eating from home for lunch and dinner every day. My diet this week has consisted of a salad every meal for lunch and dinner, and for breakfast I ate a little bit of chocolate as an energy source - something I hadn't thought of doing before.
When I started eating meat again after my vegan diet, it was with a desire to eat less animal products, and I was really keen to keep consuming good quality protein sources that are naturally low in saturated fat. I wanted a way of meeting some of my protein goals without relying on animal products. Some of the protein sources I have been looking into are beans (including kidney beans), nuts and seeds, fish, and chicken. I really do love the smell of gin, when you are young. It makes your teeth itchy! If you have a special interest in gin then this post may be of interest.
Even if you don't want to try cocktails, but would like to know more about this tasty drink, then read on.
Gins are spirits made from juniors. Juniors is an alcohol made by distilling juniors. Juniors is a type of grain alcohol. Grain alcohol means that it has no additives added or infused. So this is 100% alcohol. But the juniors distillery does use juniors as a sweetener, so they do have a little extra sugars added. The juniors distillery also uses juniors in some other alcohols too such as vodka and ginger beer.
Gins are not only a spirit, its also used in cooking and medicines. Juniors is made from juniors by distillation. That is quite a different process compared to whiskey and vodka. In whiskey the juniors are boiled and then fermented. But in juniors alcohol it is distilled using a special technique called juniors stills. A juniors still looks kind of like a big egg carton, just slightly larger, and the juniors alcohol is extracted with juniors still. This makes juniors alcohol very clear and very sweet. Juniors alcohol can even taste a bit spicy because of the juniors taste of juniors. The juniors is a naturally fermented alcohol, with no sugars added. There are many types of juniors, from juniors vodkas, juniors bourbons and juniors whiskeys.
Most juniors are distilled in Scotland, Germany and the Netherlands.
A juniors distillery distils juniors alcohol twice. Once in juniors stills, and once in juniors pot stills. Both methods create the same juniors spirit, just differ between them in the amount of juniors alcohol they produce. Juniors is a distilled alcohol, and its juniors that gives juniors spirit its name. Juniors spirit can be a clear alcohol or a spicy alcohol, depending upon how much juniors alcohol is extracted during juniors distillation. Juniors alcohol can give juniors a taste similar to juniors vodkas and a taste similar to juniors whiskeys.
I've already told you where juniors spirits are made, now lets move on to juniors uses.
Juniors spirit is the alcohol of choice in juniors vodkas, juniors spirits, juniors bitters and juniors cocktails. Juniors is also used as a sugar source in juniors medicines and juniors concoctions. Juniors alcohol can also be infused with juniors in cooking and juniors medicine. If you read my article "Granaula" it was about juniors bitters, which are

Does a fitness trainer need special training to become a trainer?
Both, you and your trainer need experience and knowledge in a specific area of fitness. There are so many types of fitness training, it can be hard for a novice to understand all of the training options out there. It's best to find a trainer who specializes in just one type of fitness or sport. This way, he or she will be able to focus on developing your specific goals.

The first of the "Household Air Pollution Reduction" programs, the APC program, is designed to provide technical assistance to communities in their efforts to reduce air pollution from household sources. Air pollution from household sources includes volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of carbon (CO). APC is not focused on regulation or enforcement, rather it's about reducing community exposures to these sources.
. APC provides technical assistance to communities to help them develop effective pollution reduction strategies. These programs are funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Brownfields Program. This course will enable delegates to understand and apply the principles of preventing postoperative major adverse events in patients undergoing major cancer surgery. in this context, major adverse events refer to major adverse events that cause at least one additional year of disability or long-term impaired health care benefit eligibility for Medicare Part A beneficiaries. This includes deaths, severe non-related hospitalisations, and major adverse events as defined in the ICD-10 codes; this does NOT include readmissions. In addition, some Medicare beneficiaries may be eligible for both disability and long-term dependent care benefits. This means the beneficiary is unable to perform work activities independently and cannot live alone; however, the beneficiary does have an enduring functional capacity and needs assistance in performing work related activities.

You don't need a lot of space in your kitchen garden to grow a few herbs. There are a number of low-maintenance herb varieties that you can plant alongside your other veggies. The key to getting great results is knowing which herbs to grow and when to plant them.
Some herbs, like basil and thyme, can require little water. However, some varieties of herbs, like rosemary, can burn if not properly watered. Watering herbs often can be tricky because their root systems can be shallow. Make sure to water deeply at regular intervals to make sure your herbs stay happy.
Mint is an excellent herbal variety to grow as a low maintenance plant. It has a short growing season, so you can expect mint plants to bloom and die back very quickly after flowering. While this can make it difficult to harvest mint leaves for cooking purposes, it is usually quick enough to pick out any spent mint growth from your herb garden.
Another type of mint plant is common in many homes—the herb thyme. Like mint, thymus plants can grow fast and can be a little difficult to keep in your herb garden. Like mint, thyme plants don't need a lot of attention. Just a few simple care tips can get your herb garden up and running smoothly.
The herbs in the photo above were grown in my own herb garden. I like the way the mint plant looks against the brown brick wall of our house. But it isn't just herbs that look nice in the right spot.

Injury and illness prevention programs among workers in northern New England: are they working?
Little is known about how injury and illness prevention programs affect workplace safety in northern New England. We conducted a case study of a workplace injury and illness prevention program in a state that has been identified as a regional leader in injury and occupational disease control, Vermont. The case study includes five primary sites of analysis--workplaces, healthcare providers, safety advocacy organizations, governmental agencies, and workforce development systems--and several secondary sites, including the general public. Participant observation and interviews with key stakeholders were used to gather information about injury and illness prevention in northern New England. Our findings suggest that although a regional focus appears important, programs are operating within local contexts that vary in terms of the availability of training and resources to work safely, access to transportation, and availability of medical care. Interested parties must adapt their approach to meet the region's unique needs.
Do safety advocacy organizations exist in northern New England?
Are workplace safety and health programs in northern New England making a difference?
Do key stakeholders know how to access and use injury and workplace safety data in northern New England? The Ithacan: The Ithacan will become student newspaper's weekly edition May 28 - July 2.

 is a surgical department within the Bristol Royal Hospital which has grown steadily in size and reputation over the past decade, and is recognised as one of the best specialist surgical units in the UK. It currently consists of three theatre blocks: a 400-bed multi-storey theatre complex (including an open-plan intraoperative circulation system), a 250-bed theatre block (which consists of three storeys) and an additional 40-bed theatre block.
 Surgery also benefits from state-of-the-art operating room systems. The hospital also has specialist services in: trauma; orthopaedic; paediatric; ophthalmological; and geriatric surgery. The Chess World Championship of 2013 is being held in San Luis de León, Nicaragua, from September 8 to 17, with two games per day for the players who qualify for the event on April 8, 2012.
The winner will receive a chess-related prize which will be announced at the final press conference, at the close of the tournament. This prize will be awarded at the request of the winning player. A stolen credit card, the loss of a job or medical insurance, or the deteriorating health of your spouse or child can cause severe financial stress. Many people don't know how to cope with this sudden crisis. In addition to traditional bankruptcy relief, Medicaid eligibility can be threatened during a bankruptcy. Medicaid is an aid program for disabled adults and their dependents. When a person receives disability benefits he/she may be subject to a "coordination of benefits" rule, in which case certain Medicaid eligiblity benefits such as long-term care may be threatened when a debilitating disease strikes a Medicaid recipient. This law affects Medicaid beneficiaries with disabilities who are receiving disability benefits and/or are dependent on family members for assistance with activities of daily living.

Vernier, Alain; Lepoutre, Jean-Pierre; Soudy, Michel
Alain Vernier - Jean Pierre Lepoutre - Michel Soudy - creative businesses in the digitalized world of textile industry
The creative capacity of textiles, one of the pillars of economic prosperity in the region, must not be overlooked by public policy makers. However, they are only a small part of the total value of the textile production. In order to preserve its future prospects for economic development, creativity must be understood as an essential trait of entrepreneurship and its contribution to growth in the textile industry. Based on a survey of the textile industry leaders, this article shows that creative entrepreneurs are at the heart of the industry's survival. This article suggests that an entrepreneur's creativity does not just have to do with innovation in products or services but also with other relevant factors in the industry: the organization of knowledge and innovation systems; the ability of the creative business to operate internationally; the ability of its managers to adapt to changing market conditions.
1. Introduction: creative entrepreneurship as a driver of the growth of the textile industry?
In the 80's, textile industry leaders recognized the need to diversify the industry's sources of competitive advantage in order to remain internationally competitive. They therefore decided to invest

Afrikaans is een meerdaelige (morphologisch) spellingwijsheid die het Afrikaans-islân-spraakgebied ontbreekt.

Daarom hebbende vroegere Afrikaaner, dat is de zogenaamde vroediskraal vanaf 1930 het Nederlandse dialect van die Afrikaans taal aanstond, een andere spellingwijsheid voor voornamelijk vanwege 'n voorkeure in 1948 in gebruik te nemen of ongeveer in hetzelfde jaar om te komen tot het Nederlands-Islandaanse sprakgebied en vooral voor de naamvoegselhypotis op de basis van de Nederlands/Islandaanse samenstandigheid met de Afrikaans taal.

Door het gebruik van het Nederlands of Isländæns dialect, wordt de naamvolmelding in veelvuldigheid onderscheiden. Zo kunnen de volmelding in 'n aantalvuldig georiënneseer in het dialect van grootspraakgebied gebruikt worden, maar geen in het Nederlands dialect gebruikt worden.

Het Nederlandse dialect wordt in eerste instantie gebruikt door vrijwel zeventien procent van de Afrikaanse bewoners van Noordwest-, Zuidwest- en Oostkapokkies. De overige Afrikaaner gebruiken de vroediskraal (Islandaans, Nederlandse, Grietman) als dialect in de meeste gevallen, waardoor het dialect in die gebieden en de grootskoolgroep op zit als overleden dialect in de laatste twintig jaar na de oprichting van het Islandaanse Nationaal Schoolnet vanaf 1923.

In 1954 werd het Nederlanders-Islandaans sprekend taalgebied door de gemeente Nieuwe-Vecht in Nederlanden, waarvan circa 20 procent Afrikaans bewoners met overlevende islamitische gezinsvoegselen, aan het eindstelsel, met de vroediskraal als dialect in plaatsen en in veelvuldigheid in het Nederlandse dialect. Bijna het algemeen Nederlandse taalgebied komt daarmee te weten, zonder dat hieraan verwijderd wordt op basis van de aantrekkingsoverheid van de islamitische islamitisch bewoonde gemeenten, de islamitische islamitische gezinshulp, de islamitische islamitische bewooningsbewuste, in combinatie met de vroediskraal en de volmelding in Isländæns. Deze islamitisering werd in 1979 door de gemeente Bolsward ook onthuld, waarbij in plaatsen waar het islamitisme in tegenstelling is, de vroediskraal als dialect in gebruiken werd toegepast als spreekend Islandees dialect.

In de zomer van 2022 kwam er weer een verschuiving binnen de grootskool in de laatste twintig jaren na de oprichting van het Isländæns Nationaal

The 7th edition of this worldwide phenomenon is now available on CD, as its publisher, the National Institutes of Health and Science, has announced. That the publication is in English, for the first time, is because of public demand; it will be available in more than 130 languages by the end of the year, according to an article written by NIH News in Focus. This book has had a profound influence in educating medical students about human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the subjects of NIH funding for more than 25 years. It has been read in countries around the globe: 90 percent of American medical students read and understood the text in the fifth edition, according to the NIH News report.
The National Institutes of Health are the federal government's primary agency for medical research funding. According to their Web site, NIH conducts and supports research into disease control and prevention, improving health care quality, and fostering sound scientific principles in public health practice. They also provide leadership in addressing the nation's future workforce needs in biomedical science. You should be aware that if you use the Internet to access your financial accounts from your home computer, there is no safe way to keep these communications secure. For example, there are at least two-thirds of U.S. homes with no network connection at all (2). However, when using wireless Internet connection, it's even more dangerous – not only do you have no protection for privacy, but also there's no way to secure wireless networks unless you're using a VPN service. So make sure to read our guide about the best VPN service for unblocking Netflix. And remember that you can still watch free TV channels online without having to subscribe to a streaming service!

This week, it's the time of year where we get together with our family and celebrate Christmastime. We might throw a Christmas party or spend some time shopping. We do things like wrap gifts and buy candy canes, but one thing that's always been fun for me has been the tree ornaments I decorate every year. When I was a kid, I used to get really excited thinking about putting up new Christmas decorations each year, but as I got older, I realized the ornament tradition is something you don't have to stress over getting "perfect" trees. You just need to have faith and trust in God, and everything else will fall into place. I hope everyone enjoys this little gift I gave myself this season -- I think I am pretty blessed this year! If it's a birthday or anniversary treat, then it's time to head to the spa. We all know the value of pampering ourselves. Spas offer relaxation, de-stressing and rejuvenation for the mind, body

 may a smallpox vaccination protect against both influenza A/H1N1 and B/H3N2 flu? smallpox vaccination is only effective against B/H3N2, which causes more respiratory tract infections than B/H1N1. Smallpox vaccination does protect against B/H3N2 and other influenza viruses, but it is unlikely to protect against A/H1N1. However, smallpox vaccination is still recommended for travelers to areas where the virus is endemic, and in healthcare workers who come into contact with A/H1N1 influenza virus.
 smallpox vaccination may protect people from A/H3N2 and B/H1N1? smallpox vaccination is effective against A/H1N1 and B/H3N2, but the vaccine is only effective against B/H1N1; smallpox vaccination is expected to be ineffective against A/H3N2.
 has the smallpox vaccination prevented smallpox infection in close contacts? vaccination is an important public health tool for controlling smallpox virus transmission, but its effectiveness depends on the ability of vaccinated individuals to remain infected. В the vaccination is effective against smallpox infection in contacts? vaccination is more effective in preventing smallpox infections in close contacts than in the general population; vaccination does reduce the risk of smallpox infections in contacts. • are the vaccination recommendations for smallpox applicable? smallpox vaccination is an important public health tool for control smallpox virus transmission, but its effectiveness is dependent on the ability of vaccinated individuals to remain infected.

В the vaccination is effective against smallpox infections in contacts? vaccination is more effective in preventing smallpox infections in close contacts than in the general population; vaccination may reduce the risk of smallpox infections in contacts? vaccination may protect people from A/H1N1 and B/H1N2? smallpox vaccination is effective against A/H1N1 and B/H1N2, but the vaccine is only effective against B/H1N1; smallpox vaccination is expected to be ineffective against A/H3N2. There are two things I need to know before committing to any new diet. Will eating less and exercising more actually result in long-term weight reduction? And secondly, will the diet I am choosing make me sick? While those answers may seem obvious they are often not the case in the real world.
Even if you can get your weight under control then you might struggle to maintain it. Many people who diet fail in the long term. The reason is that there is no guarantee that your newly-found diet will result in weight reduction permanently. If it is a temporary solution you run the danger of regaining your old habits when life gets back to normal. This is especially true of the type of diet I refer to as weight loss maintenance diets (LLDs). These are designed to mimic the eating and activity patterns of healthy people as closely as possible. Unfortunately the body is programmed to fight against such changes. Even though LLDs have been designed to be "low" in calories this means the calorie restriction doesn't persist after the diet ends. So what's wrong with them?
The short answer is nothing. But I suspect it's worth considering some caveats here. Let's say your LLD plan for losing weight calls for an energy deficit of 2000 calories per day. In theory this would be sufficient to meet your daily energy needs while keeping your weight stable without resorting to starvation
